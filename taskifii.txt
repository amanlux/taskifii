The bot’s Name is Taskifiibot , it’s username is @taskifiibot and the bot’s token is: 7833680300:AAGfGiL0gMGxiTLHWRktL3T8Ex6wW3IuJHw, it's going to be a platform where someone can delegate a task easily  and a task doer makes easy money by doing the task (usually completed within 120 hours), when a user first approaches the bot there will be the usual  “start” button below , then if they click it , The bot is going to first send a message to user that will say “Choose your language! / ቋንቋ ይምረጡ!”   and the message will include two buttons attached below it  that will say “ English” and “Amharic” respectively ,  and if the user clicks on the English button, both the english button and the amharic button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, and from here on out anything sent to them is sent in English,  but if they choose the amharic button , both the english button and the amharic button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked , then from here on out throughout the instructions if i include a message in parentheses  that will say “(This message has an amharic version)” next to a message i told you to write/ the ones i wrote OR  if i include a message in parentheses  that will say “(This button label has an amharic version)” next to a section where i write about the label of a button  , those messages/buttons will be sent to the user in their amharic version/translation (which is transaleted by you)  ,now moving on  ,  let’s say the user chose the english button for reasons disclosed earlier !After this , the bot will send a message saying “ Please set up your profile to start using Taskifii! ” (This message has an amharic version)  and below the message  there must be a button attached  below it that says “setup profile” (This button label has an amharic version), and if they click the button , firstly the button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked , then the bot is going to inquire them a series of inquiries turn by turn , then finally after the bot collects all the informations(profile inquiry replies) for their profile , it will structure and organize it all to make their profile which will be sent the user as a message i like to call the profile post (which must be a colorful way to view their profile) , and  this is the format(the profile setting up format) on how it will work (inquire the informations / profile inquiry replies) :the first profile inquiry is going to be “What is your full name?”(This message has an amharic version)  , Then if they reply with their name in the bot, the bot will include it later in the profile post with an informative and colorful emphasis on what it represents (this is mandatory for the rest of the profile inquiry replies too), (for example:- in this case , it will represent the name of the user vividly with an emphasis that it is a name)   , and also if more than one user have the same name they will be numbered in the profile post that are sent to a channel (and you will understand later which channel i mean, keep on reading) and after this inquiry is done (meaning the profile inquiry reply is acquired , meaning in this case , after the name is acquired), the bot will inquire the second profile inquiry to the user  which is” What is your phone number?” (This message has an amharic version)  , if they reply with their phone number , the  reply must be all digits except for the “+” sign than can be optionally allowed at the beginning of the phone number  if the phone number starts with 251 and also the number of digits in the reply  cannot be greater than 14 digits otherwise the bot will keep on inquiring  the user by sending a message that will say “Please enter a valid phone number!” (This message has an amharic version)  (when i say keep on , i don’t mean just randomly every second will this message be sent but what i mean is when they give the wrong reply   is when it is sent, i will say “keep on” again for another profile inquiry and other stuffs so please interpret it somewhat like this ) until they get it right in which if they do , same as the name ,the bot will include it later in the profile post with the same level of emphasis (as i told you before), then after this inquiry is done ,   the bot is going to inquire the user the third profile inquiry which is “What is your gmail/email address?” (This message has an amharic version)  , then if they reply ,  their reply must be any kind of online mailing address otherwise the bot  will keep on contacting the user by sending a message that will say  “Please enter a proper gmail /email address!” (This message has an amharic version)  until they get it right, in which if they do , the  same as the name and the phone number of the user , the bot will include later  in the profile post with the same level of emphasis , then the bot is going to inquire the fourth profile inquiry which is “What is your telegram username?” (This message has an amharic version)  ,  if they give a reply with their telegram username and if it has the characteristics of a telegram username  , the bot will include it later in the profile post with emphasis like the rest of the profile inquiry replies but if the reply doesn’t have the characteristics of a telegram username , the bot will keep on contacting them by sending a message that says “Please make sure it is a valid telegram username!” (This message has an amharic version) until they get it right , then after this inquiry is done,  the bot is going to inquire the user the 5th profile inquire which is “Give us your online banking details (Maximum 10) in this Format: Bank Name, Bank Account Number . (you can also include Telebirr like:  Telebirr, Your Phone Number and also please note that your online banking details will be shared with another Taskifii user!)”  (This message has an amharic version) ,since it’s their banking details I want it in that format like in the question I.e bank Name before the comma meaning only alphabets before the comma(there must be a comma dividing the bank name from the bank account number) and then bank account number after the comma  meaning only digits or a mixture of digits with numbers can be allowed after the comma but if they  give an answer that is not in this format , the bot will keep on inquiring the user by sending a message which is  “Please give us a valid banking details in this format: Bank Name, Bank Account Number ! (and make sure there are no grammatical errors!)” (This message has an amharic version) until the user  gets it right in which if they do, the bot will include it later in the profile post with emphasis like  all the profile inquiry replies, and then if the user either wants to add another alternative banking details or Replace the one they just gave or skip to the next inquiry , to make this happen ,the bot will send a message showcasing the banking details they have just given recently(only that) but below the message there must be three buttons which are labeled as “add” (This button label has an amharic version), “replace”(This button label has an amharic version) ,and “done” (This button label has an amharic version) respectively, and the function of the buttons is pretty much self explanatory but if you want more details , basically if the user clicks on the add button , firstly all the three buttons will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then  the bot starts again the process of acquiring a new banking details exactly like the previous one then once successfully done, it will be included later in the profile post with emphasis just like all the profile inquiry replies and send the messages with the exact three buttons but they can only add up to 10 different banking details (not all 10 at once but turn by turn by clicking the add button in the message they get after they give 1 banking detail), once they reach 10 different banking details , the bot will do something as same as if the done button was clicked in which i will tell you what happens soon  , moving on for now ! if the user clicks on the replace button , firstly all the three buttons will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then the bot will start again the same process of acquiring a new banking detail  that will ultimately  replace the banking detail that the message where the replace button was clicked on had (which will also be replaced generally and in the profile post later), but if the user clicks on the done button , firstly all the three buttons will now stop doing anything if they get clicked , then the bot will send the terms & conditions (which is kind of like the 6th inquiry but it will not be included in the profile post later)  to the user where there would be two buttons attached below it labeled “Agree” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Disagree”(This button label has an amharic version) , and you are the one who is going to write the terms & conditions (It will let them also know that if they agree with the terms and conditions ,they can click the agree button below but if they don't they can click the disagree button below), before you write it though , i want you to do an intensive and reliable research for a terms & conditions for a platform like mine/this in Ethiopia , i also want you to use your own intellect,  i also want you to know that this platform is an MVP , i also want you to know that the platform is not legally registered in any shape of form, i want you to also know that this platform will also won’t make any revenue or take any commissions , i want you to also include everything the user needs to know about this platform and how to use it (based on all the instructions in here so understand this entire instructions like the back of your hand), i also want you to let them them know the platform is not legally liable to anything yet since it is in the MVP stage(not legally registered), but the platform will try it best to keep user information hidden and encrypted for privacy reasons,  i also want you to let the user know that there is no escrow system(tell them it’s because it is an mvp, and a test product), i also want you to let them know how strict this platform is if they violate anything in the terms and conditions(you will understand what i mean when you read this whole thing ), i also want you to include every thing you think must be included in a terms & conditions statements (based on reading and understanding the whole instructions and based on your research ), also if it helps you , i will give the terms & conditions (to take inspiration from if needed)of a different freelancing platform here in Ethiopia called Afriwork, they are different from my platform  in the sense that they connect certified employers(companies, start ups,..) with long term employees , so nothing task based like mine(but also please note that they are a legally registered business unlike me) , but moving on,  this is their terms & conditions of afriwork  in a quotation  : “1.

So before i tell you what happens if the user clicks the agree button, let me tell you what will happen if the user clicks the disagree button, so if the user clicks the disagree button , firstly the two buttons will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then the bot will send a message letting the user know that it is important to understand and agree with the terms and condition to proceed  ,  the message will also let them know if they want to review the terms and conditions again and give another response,  they can click the yes button below,  the message will also include a button below it  labeled  yes (This button label has an amharic version),  if the user clicks it, firstly the  button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot  will start the terms and conditions inquiry again, in which if they click the disagree button again,  the same thing will happen as before, but if the user clicks the agree button , the bot will inquire the user the 7th inquiry(but it won’t be included in the profile post also )  by sending them a message(This message has an amharic version)  letting them know if they are 18 and above they can click the “Yes I am” button below but if they're not ,they must click the “No I'm not” button,  the message should also let them know the laws here in Ethiopia regarding to child labor and the legal age to work,  the message should also let them know that if they're under 18,  they cannot use our platform ,   the message will also include two buttons attached below it labeled as “Yes I am” (This button label has an amharic version)and “No I’m not” (This button label has an amharic version), so if they click the no i’m not button , firstly all the two buttons will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know  legally why they can't use the platform,  the message will also  let them know if they have made some kind of mistake based upon clicking the wrong button accidentally or if they became 18 years old or 18 + years old from last time they responded , and if they want to re-enter another response , they can click the “Yes” button below  , the message will include a button attached below it labeled “Yes” (This button label has an amharic version), and if the user clicks it , it will inquire the user the 7th inquiry again (with the same process, nothing will change about it ) , and  since  you know what will happen if the user clicks the “No I’m not” button , let me tell you what will happen if the user clicks the “Yes I am” button,  if the user clicks the “Yes I am” button , (before i tell you what happens next, i want you to know that other than the name and the bank name , more than one user can not have the same profile inquiry reply , if the user gives a profile inquiry reply that is taken by another user , the user will get a message  (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that this profile inquiry reply  is taken by an another user and they should give another profile inquiry reply to proceed (obviously it won’t say  profile inquiry reply in the message but instead  it will say what type of profile inquiry reply it was, For example:- if the user sends a phone number that is taken by another user , the bot will  send the user a message saying “Sorry , this phone number is already taken! Please re-enter another phone number! ”  ) ,   and then  the bot will finally send the user a colorful and welcoming message /profile post that you will craft showcasing all the profile inquiry replies they just gave in an organized and professional(don’t forget the emphasis part) way since it’s not only showcasing their profile but  there also must be a separate message  (This message has an amharic version) below the profile post that   will congradulate and thank the user for setting up a profile and registering to Taskifii , welcoming them to Taskifii, the profile post will also include the amount of birr the user has made as a task doer so far (you will understand what i mean later ), the amount of birr spent by the user as a task creator (you will understand what i mean later ) , the average of the 5 star reviews the user has gotten from previous task doers or task creators plus also the number of the users (task creators and task doers) that rated this user (you will understand what i mean later), the profile post will also include the date and time they registered to taskifii,  and  the separate message below the profile post must also include three buttons attached below it labeled  “Post a Task” (This button label has an amharic version) ,  “Find a Task” (This button label has an amharic version), and “Edit Profile” (This button label has an amharic version),  okay before I tell you what happens when the user clicks either of the 3 buttons , firstly, I just want you to know there would be a button with the same function but in a different place , so for example:  if I tell you a button that has same functionality as the “Post a Task” Button , it means they have the same functionality, I will tell you later where it is , and the second thing i want you to know is that i want to be able to control everything about the user and etc…, so the profile post will be sent to a private channel with a chat id that is “-1002310380363” , the profile post here in this channel will also include every of their past history using this bot  in an organized and structured way with emphasis , and when i say their past history using this bot i mean stuff like every task they posted ( and the name and telegram username who did the task for them or no name and telegram username if no one applied to do the task) ,Every task they did ( and the name and username of the task creator who posted the task, it should also emphasis if the task creator paid or not ) , it should also have a date and time stamp of what of everything i mentioned above , the profile post will also include any obligations they have broken so far but only if they did, but the profile post will include 4 buttons attached below  it which will be labeled as “Ban User” , “Contact User” , “Give Reviews” , and “unban user“ . And Before I tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons I want you to know if the user was banned from using the bot in the group for some kind of reason , in the giant message there would be five texts saying “this user is banned until [the time and date when their banishment ends]” ( written in red),  moving on,  if a user clicks the ban user button, it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user  letting them know  that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the user that got their ban user button below their profile post clicked  .  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to  the user that got their ban user button below their profile post clicked  . Then  the bot  will send  to the user a message  with two buttons  below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month” . And  then  if the user clicks  the day button ,  firstly the day button and the month button  will now stop doing anything if they get clicked,  then the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to keep on banning the user that got their ban user button below their profile post clicked . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will ban the user that got their ban user button below their profile post clicked  from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will ban the user that got their ban user button below their profile post clicked  from using the bot and the group for 5 days). But if the user clicked the month button, firstly the day button and the month button  will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of months they want to ban the user that got their ban user button below their profile post clicked  . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will ban the user that got their ban user button below their profile post clicked  from using the bot and the group(btw you will know what group i mean, just keep on reading the instructions) for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier, then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will the user that got their ban user button below their profile post clicked  from using the bot and the group for 5 months). But if a user clicks the unban user button, the bot will unban the user that got their unban user button below their profile post clicked from the bot and the group but this is obviously if the user that got their unban user button below their profile post clicked was banned before the unban button was clicked. But if a user clicks the contact user button,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then a message will be sent to the user through the bot letting them know that they should write a message that will be sent to  the user that got their contact user button below their profile post clicked. Then if the user gives a message or anything else,  it would be sent to  the user that got their contact user button below their profile post clicked . But if a user clicks the give reviews button , it will take the user to the bot, then the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they must now give how many stars per user they want to give the user that got their give reviews button below their profile post clicked, Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits not greator than 5 ,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive digits not greater than 5  till they only give a poistive digit not greater than 5 . But  if the user gives a reply(which i like to call star)  that is only positive  digits not greater than 5, the bot will then send a message with two buttons labeled as “TC” and “TD” to the user letting them know that they should now choose what type of user is giving the reviews to  the user that got their give reviews button below their profile post clicked, then if the user clicks the TC button , firstly the TC button and the TD button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that  they should know give how many task creator is giving the reviews to  the user that got their give reviews button below their profile post clicked, Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digit till they give a positive digit. But  if the user gives a reply(which i like to call task creators amount)  that is only positive  digits, the bot will give the user that got their give reviews button below their profile post clicked the star reply they gave earlier [task creators amount] times as if [task creators amount] task creators  gave   the user that got their give reviews button below their profile post clicked [star] stars . If you are confused , for example:- if the user first gives a reply saying “4”, then if the users clicks the TC button, then if the user gives a reply saying “10”, the bot will give the user that got their give reviews button below their profile post clicked a review of 4 stars 10 times as if 10 task creators gave  the user ,that got their give reviews button below their profile post clicked,  4 stars. But if the user would have clicked the TD button instead of the TC button,  firstly the TC button and the TD button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that  they should know give how many task doers is giving the reviews to  the user that got their give reviews button below their profile post clicked, Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digit till they give a positive digit. But  if the user gives a reply(which i like to call task doers amount)  that is only positive  digits, the bot will give the user that got their give reviews button below their profile post clicked the star reply they gave earlier [task doers amount] times as if [task doers amount] task doers  gave  the user that got their give reviews button below their profile post clicked [star] stars . If you are confused , for example:- if the user first gives a reply saying “4”, then if the users clicks the TD button, then if the user gives a reply saying “10”, the bot will give the user that got their give reviews button below their profile post clicked a review of 4 stars 10 times as if 10 task doers gave  the user ,that got their give reviews button below their profile post clicked,  4 stars.  Okay since we got these out of the way , let us go back to will happen in the bot , so let me start by telling you what happens(the functionality) if the user clicks the “Edit Profile” button (This button label has an amharic version), if they click it , it will allow them to edit specific profile inquiry reply at a time ,meaning in this format : if the user clicks the “ Edit Profile” button ,firstly all the 3 buttons(i.e post a task button, find a task button , and the edit profile button) will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then the bot will send the profile post again to them but this time , the 3 buttons will be replaced by 6 new buttons (This button label has an amharic version) , 5 of the buttons are going to labeled and represent the 5 profile inquiry replies the user wants to edit specifically(for example , there would be a button labeled as “Name” , and another one labeled as “Phone Number”, etc…), and if the user clicks any of the 5 buttons ,  all the buttons will disappear from the profile post  then the bot will start inquiring the profile inquiry reply the button represented (the inquiry process is exactly like when they were setting up the profile ) but only that specific profile inquiry reply , then once the user gives the right reply for that specific profile inquiry ,(and ooh , i almost forgot to tell you !, the 6 th button is going to be labeled as “Back” , and if it is clicked , it will just replace the 6 buttons with the original 3 buttons (Post a Task, Find a Task , and Edit Profile)),  the bot will replace the old profile inquiry reply with the new profile inquiry reply , and then bot will send the updated profile post to the user where the original 3 buttons (Post a Task, Find a Task , and Edit Profile) attached below it will  return and this updated profile post will be the new profile post of the user in which the profile post will also be updated in the profile post sent to the channel i told you earlier and also figure out a way the user can edit the banking details if they gave more than one banking details. Okay now since you know everything that will happen if the edit profile button was clicked, now i will tell you what happens if the user clicks the “Post a Task” button; if the user clicks the  “Post a Task” (This button label has an amharic version) button, firstly all the 3 buttons(i.e post a task button, find a task button , and the edit profile button) will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then The bot is going to  inquire the user specific details about the task in a specific format (task inquiry format) but before I tell you the format, the goal for the format is to inquire(task inquiry) specific information(task details/task inquiry replies) from the task creator about the task  turn by turn and finally the bot will turn those information into a post i like to call a task post in which the bot will ultimately post it on a channel with a username, @TaskifiiRemote,  in which the bot is an admin of the channel (I will tell you later , how the bot is going to post on the channel but for now let’s move on) , with that in mind , here is the task inquiry format: the bot  will inquire the user the first task inquiry which is “Write the task description. (Please be very specific with your words since the task doer is only obligated to do the task described in Task Description! And also please note that if you have any kind of file (video, image, etc…) related to the task , later you will be given a chance to send it. ”  (This message has an amharic version) and if the user replies , the reply cannot be less than 20 characters  and greater than 1250 character, if it breaks this rule, the user will get this message “Sorry, Task Description can’t be less than 20 characters or greater than 1250 characters!” (This message has an amharic version) ,until the user gets it right, in which if they do, the bot will include it later in the task post with a colorful emphasis on what it is(for example in this case the task detail is a task description so later in the task post , there would be a section that will say “Task description : [The task description the user wrote]”  and obviously when it said [The task description the user wrote] in the quotation , that is not the text that  will be displayed exactly but whatever the user wrote for the task description is what will be displayed next to the colon, and after this task inquiry is successfully done ,  the bot will inquire the second task inquiry to the user which is “If there is any file that is related to the task itself, send it here! For example:- A video footage that you want to be edited , an image that you want to be turned into a promo, etc… (Please note that this will not be visible for anyone to see in the channel, it will only be sent to the chosen task doer!  )” (This message has an amharic version)  there would also be a button below the message saying”Skip” (This button label has an amharic version) meaning if the user clicks it , the user can skip this inquiry and move on to the third task inquiry in which I will tell you soon but if they choose to give a reply (which i like to the related file) , the bot will not include it later in the task post but rather i will tell you what will happen with this task detail later  , but so that you it’s easy for you differentiate when i tell you about it later , let’s name this type of task detail as related file, okay with this in mind , once this task inquiry is successfully done, the bot will inquire the user the third task inquiry in which you will start by displaying a message upfront that informs users about the purpose of this section. The message should clearly state: "Welcome to the fields selection section! Here, you'll choose the field(s) where your task falls under. You must select at least one field and can select up to a maximum of 10 fields. Use the options below to make your selections."  (This message has an amharic version) This message ensures users understand the importance of this step before interacting with the interface.
Next, create a predefined list of remote work fields, such as Software Development, Data Science and Analytics, Cybersecurity, Cloud Computing, IT Support, DevOps Engineering, UI/UX Design, Machine Learning and AI Development, Digital Marketing, Content Writing/Copywriting, SEO Specialist, Social Media Management, Affiliate Marketing, Brand Management, PR and Communications, Email Marketing, Graphic Design, Video Editing, Motion Graphics, Animation, Product Design, Interior Design (Virtual Consultations), Photography/Photo Editing, Technical Writing, Grant Writing, Ghostwriting, Editing and Proofreading, Transcription Services, Blogging, Copy Editing, Online Tutoring, Course Creation, Instructional Design, Language Teaching (e.g., ESL), Educational Consulting, Customer Service Representative, Technical Support Specialist, Helpdesk Operations, Call Center Agent, Accounting, Bookkeeping, Financial Analysis, Tax Preparation, Business Consulting, Project Management, Virtual Assistant, Operations Management, Sales Representative, Account Management, Lead Generation Specialist, Client Relationship Manager, Telemedicine (Doctors, Therapists, Counselors), Medical Transcription, Medical Coding and Billing, Nutrition Coaching, Health and Wellness Coaching, Recruitment and Talent Acquisition, HR Consulting, Employee Training and Development, Payroll Management, Legal Research, Paralegal Services, Contract Review, Legal Consulting, Voice Acting, Music Production, Video Game Testing, Content Creation (YouTube, TikTok, Podcasts), Online Performing (Comedy, Drama, Music), Market Research, Data Entry, Policy Research, Scientific Analysis, CAD Design, Remote Monitoring and Control, Systems Engineering, Process Engineering, Translation, Interpretation, Subtitling, Localization, Dropshipping, Amazon FBA, E-Commerce Store Management, Product Listing Optimization, Real Estate Marketing, Virtual Property Tours, Real Estate Consulting, Scheduling and Calendar Management, Document Management, Scientific Data Analysis, Academic Research, Environmental Monitoring, Online Surveys and Focus Groups, Personal Assistance, Event Planning, Online Moderation, and Affiliate Marketing.
The bot will display these fields in a paginated format, showing 10 fields per page. Users can navigate between pages using ⬅️ (left arrow) to go to the previous page and ➡️ (right arrow) to move to the next page. Each field will be numbered from 1 to 10 on each page, with corresponding buttons for users to select a field. When a user selects a field, it will be added to their list of chosen fields as a hashtag (e.g., #SoftwareDevelopment),and then these hashtags will be included in the finalized task post later and the bot will prompt them with two options: Skip (This button label has an amharic version) to move on to the next inquiry or Add Another Field (This button label has an amharic version)to choose additional fields. Users must select at least one field but may choose up to a maximum of 10 fields. If a user tries to skip without selecting a field, the bot will notify them (This message has an amharic version)  that at least one field must be selected before proceeding. If the user reaches the maximum of 10 fields, the bot will automatically move on to the next task inquiry. And the user can’t click on the same field again so if the user clicks the same field button again nothing will happen.
Pagination will include safeguards to enhance usability: if the user is on the first page and presses ⬅️, the bot will notify them they are already on the first page, and if they are on the last page and press ➡️, the bot will notify them they have reached the end. This upfront message combined with the clear navigation and intuitive categorization ensures users understand the purpose of this section and have a smooth experience while selecting their fields. 

     Then once this inquiry is successfully done,  bot will inquire the user the  fourth task  inquiry which is a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has 3 buttons attached below it which are labeled as “Beginner Level Skill” (This button label has an amharic version), “Intermediate Level Skill” (This button label has an amharic version), and “Professional Level Skill” (This button label has an amharic version), and the message will let the user know that if they click the “Beginner Level Skill” button , it means this task requires beginner level skill meaning it is a task that don’t require any creativity whatsoever like(in this platform’s case) trimming a video, color grading a video, masking an image or footage, any  task (that can be done remotely) that has a lot of repetition in it , and just any time consuming remote tasks that don’t require any creativity and can not be done by AI, the message will also let them know if they click the “Intermediate Level Skill” button , it means that the task requires just a little bit of creativity , and the message must also let the user know that if they click the “Professional Level Skill” button , it means that the task requires a lot of creativity , so after the message let’s them know these, and if the user clicks on the “Beginner Level Skill” button , later in the task post a hashtag that says “#BeginnerLevelSkill” will be included in it and also there would be a section in the task post that will say “Skill level required: Beginner Level Skill” in which the “Beginner Level Skill” part  will be written in green , but if the user clicks the “Intermediate Level Skill” button , later in the task post there would be a hashtag that will say “#IntermediateLevelSkill” and there would also be a section in the task post that will say “Skill level required: Intermediate Level Skill” in which the  “Intermediate Level Skill” will be written in yellow  but if the user clicks the “Professional Level Skill” button, later in the task post there would be a hashtag that will say “#Professional Level Skill” and there would also be a section in the task post that will say “Skill level required: Professional Level Skill” in which the  “Professional Level Skill” will be written in red, okay then once if this inquiry is successfully done ,  the bot will inquire the user the 5th task inquiry which is “How much is the payment fee amount(in Birr) given for the task completion?” (This message has an amharic version) , if the user gives a reply , the reply must contain only digits and it can’t be less than 50, and also if the user gives a reply that has stuffs other than digits , the bot will send a message to the user saying “Please make sure it only contains numbers!” (This message has an amharic version) or if the reply is only digits but it is less than 50 , the bot will send a message to the user saying “Sorry, the birr amount can’t be less than 50 birr!” (This message has an amharic version) until they give the  correct answer that don’t break these two rules in which if they do ,the bot will automatically add the word “birr” next to the number and include it later in the task post (with emphasis as usual), and the bot will inquire the user the 6th task inquiry which is  “What’s the time required in hours to complete the task. ” (This message has an amharic version) , if the user replies, the reply must be only digits that are positive meaning any digits  greater than 0 since it’s hours, and the digits cannot be greater than 120 hours, so with these in mind if the reply  contains anything other than digits  , the bot will send a message to the user saying “Please make sure it only contains numbers!” (This message has an amharic version) or if the reply is digits but the digits are greater than 120 or less than or equal to  0 , the bot will send a message to the user saying “ Please note that the number of hours can’t be less than/equal to 0 hours or greater than 120 hours! ” (This message has an amharic version) , until the user gives the right answer(which will be the time required for the task doer to complete the task and submit it plus i might say later in the instruction time for task completio, time given for the task , etc… which means this reply) in which if they do , the bot will include it later in the task post where there is the word “hours” (or “hour” depending if the number is 1) next to it with emphasis as usual and then after this inquiry is successfully done, the bot will inquire the user the 7th inquiry which is “How many hour(s) do you require to review and check for any errors & mistakes in the task once the completed task has been delivered to you and make the task doer fix it? (please note that this time will also include the time where you will notify and let the task doer fix any of the mistakes they made! I.e 50% of the time for you to check for errors and notify the task doer and the rest of the 50% of the time for the task doer to send the corrected and completed task to you so please keep in mind that  the time you are willing to give the task doer to send you the corrected and the completed task  is included in the time. ” (This message has an amharic version) , and if the user gives a reply , it must be only digits but in which if the user gives a reply other than digits , the bot will send a message to the user saying “Please make sure it only contains numbers!” (This message has an amharic version) until they get it right (i.e give a reply that doesn’t break this rules , and i like calling this reply the revision time) but not only this,  the user also  must not give a time(a reply) greater than half the time given for the whole task to be completed and submitted (the 6th task inquiry reply ) but in which if the user gives a reply that is greater than half the time given for the whole task completion and submission, the bot will send a message to the user saying “Please make sure that the time you give is not greater than than half the time given for the whole task completion!” (This message has an amharic version) until they get it right but not only this , the reply also cannot be less than zero  in which  if the user gives a reply that is less than zero, the bot will send a message to the user saying  “Please make sure it is not less than zero!” (This message has an amharic version) until they get it right meaning if the user gives a reply that don’t break any of this rules, the bot will include it later in the task post with emphasis as usual, then once this inquiry is successfully done, the bot will inquire the user the 8th task inquiry which is “ Give the birr amount deducted per hour from the task fee if the task doer doesn’t deliver the completed task within the given time.” (This message has an amharic version), if the user replies , the reply must be only be postive digits and it cannot be greater than 20 % of the Task Fee and less than zero , if they reply with something other than digits , the bot will always send a message saying “Please make sure it contains only numbers!” (This message has an amharic version)  or if they give a reply that is only digits but greater than 20% of the Task Fee amount, the bot will always send a message to the user saying “Please make sure the birr amount deducted per hour is not greater than 20% of the task fee!”  (This message has an amharic version) or if the user gives a reply that is less than zero , the bot will always send a message saying “Please make sure the birr amount deducted  per hour is not less than zero!” (This message has an amharic version) but if the user gives the right answer that don’t break any of these rules ,the bot will include it later in the task post with the word “birr” next to it (with emphasis as usual) , then once this inquiry is successfully done, the bot will inquire the user the 9th task inquiry which is “In how many hours will the offer for someone to do the task expire?” (This message has an amharic version), and if the user gives a reply , the reply must not be less than 1 (1 hour) or greater than 24 (24 hours) and the reply must only be digits, if the user gives a reply that is less than 1 , the bot will send a message to the user saying “Sorry, the expiry time can not be less than 1 hour!” (This message has an amharic version) or if the user gives a reply that is greater than 24 , the bot will send a message to the user saying “ Sorry, Expiry time can not be greater than 24 hours!” (This message has an amharic version) , and if the user gives a reply that is other than digits , the bot will send a message to the user saying “Please make sure it only contains numbers!” (This message has an amharic version), but if the user gives a reply that don’t break any of these rules , the bot will include the reply later in the task post (but it will posted in a different way in the task post in which i will tell you what i mean a bit later, let’s call this task inquiry reply/task detail expiry time for easy differentiation)with emphasis as usual , then once this inquiry is successfully done, the bot will inquire the user the 10th task inquiry  which is a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has three buttons attached below it which are labeled “100%” (This button label has an amharic version), “30%:40%:30%” (This button label has an amharic version) , and “50%:50%” (This button label has an amharic version)  , and the message will let them know that if they click the “100%” button , it means they want 100% percent of the task to be delivered to them first before they pay  100% of the task fee, the message will also let them know that if they click the “30%:40%:30%” button , it means they want a Gradual Task & Payment Exchange meaning 30% Task Submission → 30% Payment, 40% Task Submission → 40% Payment, and 30% Task Submission → 30% Payment, the message will also let them know that if they click the “50%:50%” button, it means they want it means they want 50% Task Submission → 50% Payment, 50% Task Submission → Remaining 50% Payment, and if user clicks the “100%” button, later in the task post it will included as “Payment-Task exchange strategy: 100% of the task for 100% of task fee” , but if the user clicks the “30%:40%:30%” button, later in the task  post it will be included as “Payment-Task exchange strategy: 30% of the task →30%fee →40% of the task →40% task fee →30% of the task →30% task fee”, but if the user clicks the 50%:50%” button , later in the task post it will be included as “Payment-Task exchange strategy: 50% of the task →50%task fee →50% of the task →50% task fee” , (Whatever the user chooses out of the three that one is going to be the Payment-Task exchange strategy  and once this inquiry is successfully done , the bot will finally craft and send a colorful finalized  task post based on all the information(task details) they gave, since i want the potential task doers to understand the post, there would be emphasis on what every task details  the task creator has given, for example in the task post there can hypothethically be a section in it where it will say something like “Task Description: I want someone to edit an original promotion video for me”,  so this kind of emphasis goes the same  for the rest of the task details, and nothing about the user’s identity( or the user’s profile) will be on the task post because i want the everything about task creator’s to be anonymous till they find the correct task doer through a process in which i will tell you how that works a bit later , but moving on for now, below the post ,there must be a two buttons in which one of them is labeled “Edit Task”(This button label has an amharic version) and the other one is labeled “Post Task” (This button label has an amharic version) , if the user clicks on the “Edit Task” button, it allows the user to edit specific details about the task details individually if it is clicked on , for example the if the user clicks on the “Edit Task” button ,the task post will be sent again to the user but the two buttons below will change into the 10 task details labeled  button that the user wants to edit specifically , for example , if the user clicks on the “task description” button, the buttons on the task post will disappear first  ,then the bot  will inquire the task description exactly with the same process(task inquiry format) as before , then after the user gives the right answer,  an edited and an updated task post will be sent to user with the new task description in it , and the same process works for the rest of task details via if their button is clicked(and figure out a way the task creator can edit the fields because there might be more than one field selected)  , but above the newly and updated post , there would be a separate  message letting the user know that whatever  task detail they wanted to edit has been successfully edited  , and below the newly and updated task post , the two buttons will return which are the “Edit Task” button and the “Post Task” button, and since you know what will happen if the user clicks on the “Edit Task” button i don’t have to tell you again but now i will tell you what happens if the user clicks on the “Post Task” Button ,so if the user clicks on the “Post Task” button, before the bot will post it in a channel with a chat id : “-1002254896955” or a username : “@TaskifiiRemote” , bts the bot will  add a green bold text saying “Task is open!” in the first and  above section of the task post signifying that the task is open for anyone to do(but this text will change to “Task is taken!” (written in red) once an accepted task doer has clicked the “Do the task” button later (you will understand later what i mean), but if no one applies for the task before the expiry time (or if no one clicks the “Do the task” button  before the expiry time or if  task creator doesn’t click on the accept button of any apply post before the expiry time  )  , the text will change to “Task is no longer available!” (written in blue))  and in the below section of the task post, there would be a part where it will display of how much birr the user has successfully made so far (meaning the bot will track and record this starting from the user’s registration till forever)as a task doer (with a little emphasis that it is the money they made as a task doer) and also a display of how much birr the user has successfully spent (with a little emphasis that it is the money they spent as a task creator)meaning the bot will track and record this starting from the user’s registration till forever) as a task creator , there would be be a part where it will  the display  the average of the stars reviews the user has gotten out of the 5 stars starting from the time they registered to this bot (which is btw derived from the 5 stars rating systems) , but don’t get confused , i don’t mean that  anyone can rate on it while it is being displayed on the task post   later on the channel , meaning the rating between the task doer and task creator will happen later at the end meaning  after both have agreed and finished their obligations in which i will tell you later more detaily , but for now let's move on !,  here in the task post, the average of the stars review that the user has gotten is the one that will be displayed, including the number of users that rated this user displayed next to it, and also the expiry time the task creator has given earlier will be first added on to the exact time when the task post was/will be posted then whatever the result is, will be displayed as the task detail as a date and time stamp in EAT(12 hour format) (signifying when it will expire) in the task post ,  and also the task post will include a section  displaying  the bank names(with a short emphasis emphasizing that this bank names signify the online banking system the task creator uses or supports)  they use( they gave this in the profile inquiry format  but here only the bank names ( if there are more than one Bank names they  will be divided by commas)will be displayed , not the bank account numbers. So then the bot will finally post the task post on the channel , in which  there would also be a button attached below the task post that will say “Apply” (This button label has an amharic version). And the countdown till the expiry time is up will begin as soon as the task post is posted on the channel and i will tell you later what will happen when the expiry time ends. Moving on,  before i tell you what happens if a user clicks the apply button, i want you to know that after the task post is posted on the channel, the task creator will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that from now onwards every  one that applied to do their task, the applier’s /task doer’s apply post which will include two buttons namely Accept and Decline will be sent here for them (the task creator) to pick the ones they want to be their task doers  by clicking the Accept button in which whichever task doer confirms first that they(the task doer) want to do the Task will be their(the task creator’s) task doer and if they don’t want a particular task doer , they can click the decline button on that task doer’s apply post or not click any of the two buttons, the message will also let them know that if they click the accept button of a apply post, there is no going back meaning they can’t cancel or not pay after the completed task is delivered to them but this is obviously of course if the task doer confirms if they still want to do the task , The message would also let them know  that if they want to delete the task post now , they can click the cancel  task button below, the message will also let them know that if they plan to click  the cancel task button , they must click it before they click the accept button on any apply post. Below the message there would also be a button attached to it saying “Cancel Task” (This button label has an amharic version) in which if it is clicked, it will make the apply button disappear and then delete the task post posted on the channel and notify (This message has an amharic version) the task creator that the task has been successfully deleted. But they(the task creator) have to click it before they click the accept button on any task doer’s apply post and before the expiry time is up , otherwise the cancel task button will then stop doing anything if it gets clicked. But if the task creator clicks the cancel task button before clicking the accept button of any apply post and before the expiry time is up, as i told you before ,it will make the apply button of the task disappear and delete the task post posted on the channel and notify (This message has an amharic version) the task creator that the task has been successfully deleted but also if there was apply posts sent to the task creator before clicking the cancel task button , the apply post’s accept button and decline button will disappear , and the apply posts will also include a text saying “Sorry, task is canceled!”, and a message will also be sent to all the task doer that applied or were applying(stopping the application process then and there) letting them apologetically know that the task creator has canceled the task and that they should find other tasks to do by clicking the find a task button below in the menu.
 Okay now before i tell you what happens if a user clicks the apply button , i want you to know that if the user clicks the find a task button earlier from the profile post ,firstly the find a task button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) with two buttons attached below it labeled as “Go to channel”(This button label has an amharic version) and “Filter Tasks” (This button label has an amharic version), The message would let the user know that if they click the go to channel button it would take them straight to the channel where they can look for  specific tasks to do,  the message will also let them know that if they click the filter tasks button  it will  bring  at most 15  tasks of their preference. Then  if the  user clicks the go to channel button,  firstly both the buttons will now stop doing anything if they get clicked , then the bot will take them(the user) straight to the channel where the task posts are posted meaning the channel with the chat id “-1002254896955” ,  but if the user clicks the filter tasks button,  firstly  the go to channel button and the filter tasks button will now stop doing  if they get clicked , then the bot will inquire three inquiries that are based of three task inquiries , then based on the reply they give, the bot will bring at most 15 active task posts  that have the elements or inquiry replies that user gave and how they will be used to filter tasks /task posts , what i mean is that  the first inquiry the bot is going to inquire the user is the skill level inquiry from earlier in the task inquiry format but the only difference this time is the inquiry message lets the user know the meaning of what will happen if they click the buttons with the  skill level labeled on them in a way that let’s them know what kind of skill level requiring tasks they want or prefer , and then once/if the inquiry is successfully done, the bot will later(once all the three inquiries are successfully done) bring at most 15 active task posts that require the skill level the user wanted , then the bot will inquire the user the second inquiry which is the fields inquiry from earlier in the task inquiry format , and  once this inquiry is successfully done rather than the user’s reply being included in the task post as a hashtag, this time their reply will be used later (once all the inquiries are successfully done )to also bring task posts that have the field/s the user gave with the skill level they gave earlier , then the bot will inquire the user the third and final inquiry which is the task fee inquiry from earlier in the task inquiry format , but the only difference is that the inquiry message is message inquiring them the minimum task fee they are willing to accept to do a task rather than what they are willing to pay a task doer to complete the task as described in the task inquiry format  (because they are the task doer here!) , and then once this inquiry is successfully done, the bot will later(once all the three inquiries are successfully done) bring at most 15 active task posts that have task fees greater than the reply(number) the user gave plus the field/s they want plus the skill level requirement they want, but first the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the user letting them know taskifii is fetching tasks they(the user) desired and that they(the user) should wait at most 2 minutes . Then the bot will now bring at most 15 active task posts (btw when i say active task posts i mean task posts that have the “Task is open!” text in the above section of task posts) that have all the things the user wants (based on the reply they gave in the three inquiries earlier and how i told you the replies will be used to filter task posts ) within 2 minutes . But also once the 2 minutes are up and there are no tasks(task  posts) that the user desired , a message (This message has an amharic version)  will be sent letting the user apologetically know that the tasks they desired weren’t found. Or once the 2 minutes are up and there were the tasks(task post’s) the user wanted but not 15 of them , a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the user letting them know taskifii was only able to fetch this tasks that best suited their preference. Or if the two minutes wasn’t up but  15 task posts/tasks that best suited the user’s preference were brought by the bot to the user , the bot will stop waiting till the 2 minutes are up and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting the user know here are the tasks they desired.  Then after any of these conditions is done,   the go to channel button and the filter tasks button will start functioning the way they were supposed to again if they get clicked.      Okay moving on! Now if the apply button(on a task post) is clicked  , it will start the application process, and here is the format/ process (Application Format) of what will happen if the any user(which will make them the potential task doer) clicks on it but first understand that the goal here is to inquire(apply inquiry) specific information(apply inquiry reply) from the potential task doers turn by turn then at the end of this format,  the bot will combine this informations and turn them to the finalized apply post that i like to call an apply post  that will be sent to the task creator with some buttons attached below it (i will tell you more details later) :  if the user clicks on the “Apply” button below the task post, it will take them straight to the bot and in which the bot will firstly inquire them by sending a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they must  write something  (that explains what they bring to the table (to do the task))that is less than 500 characters and greater than 20 characters, And the message should also let them know  that they can include any kind of file attachments like portfolios and other like stuff  but they shouldn't forget to add a caption. So with this in mind(after this message) if the user gives a reply that is less than 20 characters  ,  the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to them saying “Please make sure it is greater than 20 characters!” or if the user gives a reply that is greater than 500 characters, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) saying “Please make sure it is less than 500 characters!” , and if the user gives a reply that don’t break any of these rules, the bot will include it later in the apply post with emphasis as usual , then the bot will secondly inquire the user by sending a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled “Yes” (This button label has an amharic version) and “No” (This button label has an amharic version) , the message will also let  them know that if they want to send the apply post to the task creator, they should click the yes button below but if they don't want to , they can click the no button below . If the user clicks the “Yes” button , the finalized apply post that will also include the task doer’s name , the birr amount the task doer has made so far as a task doer , 5 or at least 1 of the most frequent task field/s that the task doer has done a task under so far , and a display of the average of the 5 stars review the user has gotten so far out of the 5 stars  from previous  task creators (i will tell you when the users will rate each other, be patient) where the number of the users(task creators specifically) that rated this user(task doer) will be next to it plus the bank names of the task doer( the user gives this in the profile inquiry format  but here only the bank names( if more than one Bank names they'll be divided by commas) will be included,  not the bank account number) plus including two buttons that are attached below this apply post which are namely “Accept” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Decline” (This button label has an amharic version) (i will tell you what will happen if the task creator clicks the buttons in a moment) will be sent without quoting  to the task creator directly through the bot . Then the task creator will decline the apply posts (i.e the task doers) by clicking on the decline button (which will make the bot send a message (This message has an amharic version) letting the declined task doers know that the  task creator has declined their apply post and they should move on and apply to do other tasks in the channel ) , and also the apply post were the decline button was clicked on will have on the above section of it a red text saying “Declined” (This message has an amharic version). And also the Accept and the decline buttons of the declined apply post will disappear. But, if the task creator wants the task doer , they can choose them by clicking the accept button . And once the button (the “Accept” button) is clicked , it will first make the “Cancel Task” button from earlier stop doing anything if it is clicked. The apply post that the accept button was clicked on will have on the above section of it , a text in green saying “Accepted” (This message has an amharic version). Then the Accept and the decline button of the accepted apply post will disappear. And also the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) with two buttons attached below it labeled as “Do the task” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Cancel” (This button label has an amharic version)  to the task doer (that got accepted by the task creator). And the message lets them know that if they want to do the task , hhhhhhhhhhhthey must click the “Do the task” button below quickly before other task doers do , and the message will also let them know that if there is no other task doer competing to do the task  , they(the task doer that this message is addressed to) have time to click the “Do the task” before [expiry time in the task post] or they will miss their chance to do the task , the message will also let them know that if they don’t want to do the task , they can click the cancel button below. And before i tell you what happens if the user clicks any of these two buttons , i want you to know that the bot will also simultaneously send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that [the Accepted task doer’s name] has been notified that they have been chosen by the task creator(in the message it will say “you”) to do the task. The message will also let them know that as soon as a task doer confirms that they still want to do the task , they (the task creators) will be notified so they shall wait till/if the task doer confirms in time. Moving on , if the task doer clicks the “Cancel” Button , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that [the Task doer’s name that clicked the cancel button] has canceled to do the task. And also another message will be sent to the task doer letting them know that they have successfully canceled doing the task. And also the do the task button and the cancel button from earlier will now stop doing anything if they get clicked.  Moving on, Before i tell you what happens if a task doer clicks the Do the task button , i want you to know that if no one clicks both the do the task button and the cancel button before the expiry time is up , a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “Repost Task” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator letting them know that sadly no one confirmed to still wanting to do the task ,the message will also let them know that  they can repost the task if they want , the message will also let them know that taskifii is sorry for this. Then the do the task button and the cancel button will also now stop doing anything if they get clicked. A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that their time to confirm and start doing the task is up . And before i tell you what happens if the task creator clicks the repost task button , i forgot to tell you  that for the accepted task doers ,a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to them every 20% of the time remaining til the expiry time is up until the task doer either clicks one of the buttons (either the do the task button or the cancel button) before the expiry time is up  or until the expiry time is up , and  the message let’s them know that they should choose a choice before [remaining time till the expiry time is up] .And if none of the accepted task doer/s  click the do the task button or the cancel button before the expiry time , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to all the accepted task doer/s letting them apologetically know that they can no longer do the task because the time to confirm that they started doing the task is up . And also a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to all the non accepted task doers (that applied but neither got accepted or declined by the task creator) letting them know that the [the task creator’s name] didn’t choose them to do the task unfortunately and that they should have better luck next time.  And also the buttons from earlier (the do the task button and the cancel button )will now stop doing anything if  they get clicked . And moving on! If the task creator clicks the repost task button, firstly the repost task button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the task post will be sent to the task creator with two buttons replacing the apply button and these buttons are labeled as “Post Task” and “Edit Task” . And a separate message (This message has an amharic version) attached below will be sent letting the task creator know that if they want to make any changes to the details of the task , they can click the Edit Task button  but if they want to just post as it is , they can click the post button below. If the task creator clicks the edit task button, it will have the same function as before,  so as the post task button as well . Also before i continue , i want you to know that if no one even applied to do the task before the expiry time or if the task creator didn’t click any apply post’s Accept button before the expiry time or if no accepted task doer/s click the do the task button before the expiry time is up  , in the above section of the task post in the channel will change from “Task is open!” to “Task is no longer available!” (written with ink colors i told you earlier), and also the apply button attached to the task post will disappear . And also  if no one even applies to do the task before 75 % percent of the expiry time is up  or if the task creator didn’t click any apply post’s Accept button before 75 % of the expiry time is up or if no accepted task doer/s clicks the do the task button before 75% of the expiry time is up, the task post will be pinned on the channel right after 75% of the expiry time has passed and it will remain pinned in the channel until a task doer clicks the do the task button for the task before 90% of the expiry time has passed or until 90% of the expiry time has passed.  And if the apply post/s are being sent to the task creator and if the task creator doesn’t click the accept button in any of the apply post before the first 50% of the expiry time is up , a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator  every 20% of the remaining 50% of the expiry time until the task creator either clicks the accept button of a apply post or until the expiry time is up, and the message let’s them know the remaining time they got till the expiry time is up, the message also let’s them know  that they need to choose a suitable task doer before the offer for someone to do the task expires. And if no one applied to do the task before the expiry time is up, a message (This message has an amharic version) with the same repost task button from earlier attached below it  will be sent to the task creator letting them  apologetically know that no one applied to do the task. And if the task creator clicks that button , it will have the same function as before. Now before i tell you what happens if the task doer clicks the do the task button, i want you to know that what happens next after the do the task button is clicked depends upon the payment-task exchange strategy. 

If the task had the 100% payment-task exchange strategy on it and if a accepted task doer clicks the do the task button, a message (This message has an amharic version) that might also include a button attached below it labeled as “Violation” (This button label has an amharic version) (this button will only exist if the the task creator gave a related file earlier in the task inquiry format and also in which if they did, the related file the task creator gave earlier will be attached above the message ) will be sent to the task doer letting them know that they have to now start doing the task, the message will also let them know that they have [ the time given to complete task] to finish and submit the task here (in the bot). And if there is a related file , the message will also let them know that the task creator also gave the file above that have a  relation to the task ,  the message will also let them know that if the related  file has some other instructions or more work for them to do that is outside the task description, they can choose not to do it by reporting(i like to call it a violation report) it to taskifii  by clicking the violation button below, The message will also let them know that if they click the violation button, they will a reason why , then the issue will be studied and if there is no problem found(meaning if the related file doesn’t have more  instructions or work not described in the task description)  , they will be strictly banned from using taskifii for a while plus if they do the same mistake again next time , there would be a monetary punishment to pay to use taskifii again, the message will also let them know that if they intend to click the violation button , they have to click it within [15% of the time given for the task ]. I will tell you what will happens if the violation button is clicked or not clicked but for now let’s move on. I want you to know that  after the do the task button is clicked ,the bot will also   change a couple of details about the task post and that is that the text “Task is open!”  in the above section of the task post in the channel will change to “Task is taken!” (written in the ink color told you earlier) and also the apply button will disappear from the task post in the channel and also the accept & decline buttons of all apply posts the task creator has already received will disappear . And also all incoming apply posts will be canceled and also A message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to all the rest of the task doers that  applied and got accepted but didn’t click the do the task button before the first task doer that clicked the do the task button  letting them apologetically know that the task is taken by another task doer that clicked the do the task button quicker than them and they should have better luck and speed next time if they want to have a better chance, the message will also let them know that they should find other tasks to do . A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to all the rest of the task doers that applied but didn’t get neither accepted nor declined and all the rest of  task doers that were applying(i.e if they were in the application format(which will also cancel the application format)) letting them apologetically know that the task creator has chosen another task doer to do the task so they should move on and find other tasks to do. And all the rest  of  task doers that were applying(i.e if they were in the application format) only for this will have their application format stop doing anything(essentially meaning the application process or format will be canceled because the task creator already found a task doer) and if there were buttons in their stage of application format, the buttons will now stop doing anything if they get clicked. Moving on, after  the do the task button was clicked ,  The do the task button and the cancel button from earlier will also now  stop doing anything (if they get clicked) for all the task doers that got accepted including the one that clicked the do the task button first. And also if more than one  accepted task doers clicks the do the task button at exactly the same time, the bot will randomly choose one of them as the one that clicked the do the task button first. And also the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has begun doing the task , the message will also let them know that if the task doer sends the completed task , it will then be sent to them(the task creators) here through the bot ,  the message will also let them know  that the task doer has [time given for the task] to finish the task. And also on the task doers side , the bot will make the violation button stop doing anything when clicked if no one clicks it before 15% of the time given for the task has passed , not only this but if the time has passed (i.e after the first 15% of the time given for the task has passed) and if the task doer clicks the violation button after the time has passed , only for the first click, a message (This message has an amharic version)  will be sent to the task doer letting them know that their time to click the violation button is up so they should finish doing the task and submit it within the time given.  But then If the task doer clicks the violation button in time, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  with a button attached below it  labeled as “ Cancel Report” (This button label has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them  know taskifii will get to the bottom of this but taskifii needs their (the task doer’s ) help by telling taskifii at least one thing in the related file (or the file the task creator attached to the task) that creates more work not described in the task description,  the message  will  also let them know  that they got 5 minutes to give that  reason or more , otherwise they will be obligated to complete the task,  the message will also let them know that the 5 minutes is a part of the time given to finish and submit the task so they must be sure about it , the message will also let them know that if they are not sure about it and want to change their idea, they can click the Cancel report button below quickly  ,The message will also let them know that once they click the cancel report button ,there's no going Back  meaning no more  getting a chance  to report something in the related file that causes more work not described in task description. 
And then if the task doer sends a message or something within 5 minutes , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has claimed that the task creator (in the message it will say “you”) has included non agreed upon extra work in the file  that the task creator  (in the message it will say “you”)  attached , the message will also let them know that taskifii will get to the bottom of this and punish the one who is found guilty, the message will also let the task creator know that the taskifii team has a lot complaints like this to resolve so  it might take a while til taskifii studies this case , the message will also let them know that they (the task creator) can’t unfortunately use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this.  And also from the task doer side a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent letting them know that they have successfully sent the violation report to taskifii, the message will also let them know that they shall wait till taskifii team studies this case and gets to the bottom of it , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this. Then both the task doer and the task creator will be banned from using both the group (which has this chat id: “-1002239730204”)( and btw  later on ,if i say group , i mean this group with this chat id) and this bot until i can study this case and confirm the one who is guilty and the way this happens is once the task doer gives a message or anything within 5 minutes after clicking the violation button(which we have discussed earlier) , the related file, the task post without the apply button, the task doer’s name with emphasis ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the  task creator’s phone number with emphasis,  and  the message or whatever the task doer sent to the bot within 5 minutes after clicking the violation button will all be sent to another channel (which has the chat id :--1002432632907) as one giant message(which will have two hashtags in it saying “#Violation” and “#UnCompleted”) with seven buttons  attached below it labeled as “Contact Task Doer” , “Contact Task Creator”, “ keep blocking task doer”, “keep blocking task creator”, “Unblock task doer”, “Unblock Task creator” and “Completed” .  And if the contact task doer  button is clicked ,  it will take the user that clicked it, to the bot ,  and then  a message  will be sent to the user  through the bot  letting them know  that they should write a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then  if the user gives a message  or anything else,  it will be sent to the task doer.  But if the user clicks the contact task Creator button,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then a message will be sent to the user through the bot letting them know that they should write a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or anything else,  it would be sent to the task creator . 
 But  if the keep blocking task doer  button was clicked  by a user,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user  letting them know  that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task doer.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task doer later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task doer (i will explain how next) . Then  the bot  will send to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month” . And  then  if the user clicks  the day button , the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 days).  But if the user clicked the month button,  the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of months they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning  the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task doer is banned/kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task doer will then get 5 one-star reviews as if  5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task creator, the task creator  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator five-star reviews. Then in the giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task doer” (written in red color).  But if a user clicks the unblock task doer button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task doer . Then the bot will unban the task doer from the bot as well as the group.  But if a user clicked the keep blocking task creator button , it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task creator.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task creator later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task creator (i will explain how next). Then  the bot  will send  to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month”.  And then if the user clicks the day button , the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to keep on banning the task creator. Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 days). Then if the user gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier, then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task creator is kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task creator will then get 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task doer, the task doer  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-star reviews. Then in the then giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task creator” (written in Blue color). But if a user clicks the unblock task creator button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task creator . Then the bot will unban the task creator from the bot as well as the group. Okay but if the completed button is clicked , it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. I also want you to know that if the giant message will then have the text “The guilty is the task creator” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task creator button) and next time if the task creator gets a violation report for the second time , the giant message will then have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task creator”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task creator again” , then the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task doer [half the task fee they(the task creator) planned to pay the first victim task doer] birr and till they pay the second victimized task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) were supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr , the message will also include both of the task doer’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doers, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task doer will be un banned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task doer) letting them know that taskifii has found the task creator guilty so the task creator [task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii  . And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task doer a message letting them know that a previous task creator they have worked with in the past by the name [task creator’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task creator) did to them (the task doer) in the past to another task doer , the message will also let them know that because the task creator repeated their mistake again , the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they pay half of the task fee they were supposed to pay them (the task doer) to them (the task doer) plus another corresponding task fee to the other task doer, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task creator sends the monetary punishment they (the task doer) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task creator to only click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task doer, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they send as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that they must now send the receipt of payment for the second victimized task doer. Then if the task creator gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will exactly wait till the first victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task doer the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version), and the message will let them know that a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name] has finally sent the punishment fee of [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the first victimized task doer] birr to them(the first victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will also wait exactly till the second victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then bot will send to the second victimized task doer the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “ I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task creator was supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr to them(the second victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will ban(or keep on banning) the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s telegram username, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to first victimized task doer], the task creator’s telegram username, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#FVTD” ,and “#violationguilty2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button (which i will explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (first victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews each as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task doer would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task doer clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (and obviously fyi ,this sent button will appear  if the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens with more details , for now just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message(This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because both the task doers have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. Then also the bot will give the task creator 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews and the bot will also give both the task doer 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creator gave the task doer five-stars.And btw ,I forgot to tell you that ,as soon as the first victimized task doer or the second victimized task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task doer would have clicked the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task doer  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then the second receipt , the second victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s telegram username,  the second victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis ,the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to second victimized task doer] birr,  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#SVTD” ,and “#violationguilty2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button  is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doers five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task creator again” text in it  and if the task creator gets the violation report for the third time or more in the future , then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttc”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task creator is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttc button , the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e adding non agreed upon extra work in the related file) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) was going to pay by the task doer] birr , the message will also include the task doer’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that after taskifii studied the case , the task creator has been found guilty so the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer). And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task creator to click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task creator) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt .

Okay going back now, I also want you to know that if the giant message would have had the text “The guilty is the task doer” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task doer button) and next time if the task doer gives a violation report for the second time again  (i.e by clicking the violation button and then sending a message within 5 minutes) , the giant message  sent will have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task doer”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task doer again”,  then the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first or the former victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr and till they pay the second or the current victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.

And btw , as soon as the first victimized task creator or the second victimized task creator clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button,both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task creator  will be unbanned from the bot and the group, then  the second receipt , the second victimized task creator’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis ,the second victimized task creator’s telegram username ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee of the task the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator],  task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#SVTC” ,and “#violationguilty2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars each . Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task doer again” text in it  and if the task doer gives the violation report for the third time or more in the future , then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttd”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task doer is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttd button , the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e give a violation report while they were the ones who were the guilty ones by giving a false alarm violation report) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the task creator] birr , the message will also include  task creator’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that after taskifii studied the case ,the task doer has been found guilty so the task doer  has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creator). And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task doer) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), when the task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , the bot will send to the task creator the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator] birr to them (the task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task creator’s name with emphasis ,the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#TC” ,and “#violationreport3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because  the task creator have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task creator  clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 







       






 Okay going back now , i want you to know that after the task doer clicked the violation button, the bot will also keep on sending a separate message (This message has an amharic version)  every minute till the task doer either clicks the cancel report button within 5 minutes or till the task doer sends a message or something within 5 minutes or till the 5 minutes are up, and the message will essentially let them know how much time they got to send a message. 
But If the task doer doesn’t send a message or something within the 5 minutes after clicking the violation button, a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task doer letting them know that their time to give the message or violation report is up, the message will also let them know that they have to now only send the completed task or proof of task completion here to the bot  within[the remaining time till the time given for the task is up].Then  the cancel request button will stop doing anything if it gets clicked . Then the bot will wait for the task doer to send the completed task within the remaining time til the time given for the task is up(in which i will tell you later what happens if this happens or not) . And btw if you didn’t know by now,  as soon as the task doer clicked the do the task button,  in perfect circumstances(i.e if the task doer didn’t click the violation button and then send a message within 5 minutes after clicking it) ,the bot will wait for the task doer to send the completed task to the bot within the time given for the task.
 And before i tell you what happens if the task doer  sends the completed task in time , i will first tell you What happens if the task Doer doesn’t send the task within the time given to  complete and submit the task(i.e. time given for task). But before i tell you it , i want you to know that the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer every 20% of the remaining time after the first 45% of the time given for the task has gone by, and the message will let the task doer know that they got [the remaining till the time given for the task is up] to submit the completed task to the bot. But the bot will only keep on sending this message to the task doer till either  the task doer sends the completed task to the bot within the time given for the task or till the time given for the task is up .   Okay moving on, If the task doer doesn’t send the completed task or proof of the task completion within the time given for the task , a alertful message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task doer every 20% of the remaining time til the task fee reaches zero amount (sorry for confusing you, the reason why task fee will reach zero amount is because the birr amount deducted per hour from the task fee(the task creator would have given this earlier in task inquiry format) will start being deducted from the task fee every hour once the task doer missed the chance to send the completed within the time given to do the task) and the messages will be kept on being sent to the task doer til either the task doer sends the completed task within the remaining time til task fee reaches zero amount or till the task fee reaches zero, the message will warn them that they were late to submit the completed task so starting from the current time  [birr amount deducted  per hour from task fee] birr  (the task creator gave this  earlier in the task inquiry format) will be deducted from their task fee till either the task fee reaches zero birr amount or til they send the completed task, the message will also let them know that if the task fee reaches zero amount before they submit the completed task to the bot, they will be banned from using taskifii for two months and if they repeat this mistake again, there would be a monetary punishment to use taskifii again i.e they will pay half the task fee to the former victim task creator and the new victim task creator, the message  will also let them know that they got [the remaining time til the task fee reaches zero] to submit the task . 
And also an alertful message (This message has an amharic version)  will be sent to the task creator every 20% of the remaining time til the task fee reaches zero amount (the reason why it will reach zero amount is because the birr amount deducted per hour from the task fee (the task creator would have given this earlier) will start being deducted from the task fee every hour once the task doer missed the chance to send the completed task  with in the time given to do the task and til either the task doer sends the completed task within the remaining time till task fee reaches zero amount or till the task fee reaches zero amount , and the message let’s them know that the task doer hasn’t  delivered the completed task within the time given for the task , the message will also let them know that  [ the birr amount deducted per hour from task fee] birr will be deducted from the task fee every hour til either the task fee reaches zero amount or til the task doer sends the completed task before the task fee reaches zero amount. 
Okay then if the task doer sends the completed task before the task fee reaches zero amount (or also if the task doer would have sent the completed task ,  then the completed task the task doer sent  would be sent to the task creator with a message (This message has an amharic version) attached  below it  and the message will have two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Fix” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Continue” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that the task doer has sent this completed task to them,  the message will also let them know that they must check for any errors or mistakes  made by the task doer,  the message will also let them  that if they find  an   error or mistake  made by the task Doer ,they(the task creator) can notify and make the task Doer  fix whatever the error or mistake they(the task doer) made,  the message will also let them know that they got [the first 50% of the Revision Time] (the task doer gave earlier in the task inquiry) to click the fix button and give a message that will be sent to the  task doer to fix any mistakes they might have made ,  the message will also let them know that  the  task doer  will fix the mistakes  and send the updated  completed task within [the remaining time til the revision time ends], the  message will also let them know that if they click  the  continue button  it means that there is no error or mistake in the completed task the task doer sent ,  the message will also let them know that if they click the continue button,  it means  that they have ended the revision time  to check for errors,  the message will also let them know  that if they don't click the fix button within [the first 50% of the revision time] , it's going to be taken as the completed task sent has no error or mistakes in it.  And also while this message is being sent to task creator, another message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task doer  letting them know that they have successfully sent the completed task,  the message will also let them know that the task Creator is reviewing and checking for any kind of errors or mistakes they(the task doer) might have made,  the message will also let them know that the task creator has [the first 50% of the revision time] to notify you about any kind of errors or mistakes they(the task doers) might have made so that they (task doers)can quickly fix them and send the updated ,correct and  completed task here (to the bot), the message will also let the task doer know that they must  wait attentively for at most [the first 50% of the revision time] til/ if the task creator notifies about a potential mistake or error they (the task doer) must fix so that they(the task doer) can use their remaining time til the time given to send the updated and completed task is up . Then after both this messages is sent to the receivers  , and then  if the task creator clicks the fix button  before the first 50% of the revision time has passed, a message (This message has an amharic version)  with a button attached below it labeled as “Accidental Request” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator letting them know that they should write  one message letting the task doer know every mistakes & errors they(the task doer) must fix, the message will also let them know that they must make everything clear for the task doer to understand , the message will also let them know that they got [the remaining time til the first 50% of the revision time is up] to send the message here(to the bot). Before i continue , i forgot to tell you that a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator every 20 % of the first 50% of the revision time  till they either click the fix button or the continue button , and the message let’s them know how much time they got to click the fix button and notify the task doer any errors or mistakes to fix if there is any,  the message will also let them know that if they click the continue button before [the remaining time til the first 50% of the revision time is up] or if they don’t click any of the two buttons  within  [the remaining time till the first 50% of the  revision time is up],  it means that  there's no error or mistake  with the completed task the task doer has sent . Moving on,  as i told you earlier , if the task creator clicks the fix button, firstly the fix button and the continue button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, and then  a message (This message has an amharic version)  with the button attached below it  labeled as  “Accidental Request”  (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator, and i also told you what the message states but i forgot to tell you that after the task creator clicks the fix button , the bot will also send a separate message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator since  every 20% of the remaining time till the first 50% of the revision time is up letting them know that they got [remaining time til the first 50% of the revision time is up] to send the message that notifies the task doer what mistakes or errors to fix; But also  the bot will only keep on sending this messages till either the first 50% of the revision time is up or till the task creator sends something(anything) to the bot before the first 50% of the revision time is up. Moving on,  if the task creator clicks the fix button and  then sends a message or anything else that notifies the task Doer the mistakes they should fix , the message or whatever the task creator sent plus a separate message (This message has an amharic version)  with a button attached below it labeled as “Non-Agreed upon” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent  to the task doer, and if it is a message the task creator sent, then it will be sent to the task doer in quotations letting the task doer know the task creator sent this message and the separate message sent to the task doer will let them(the task doer) know that the task creator wants them(the task doers) to fix the mistakes described above that they(the task doer) might have made , the separate message will also let them know that they got [ the remaining time til the revision time is up] to submit the corrected and finalized task, the separate message will also let them know that if the task creator is trying to make you fix a mistake or error that they (the task doer) didn’t make i.e anything not described in the task description, they can click the non-agreed upon button below , the separate message will also let them know that if they plan to click the non-agreed upon button , they must click it within [the first 15% of the remaining time till the revision time is up]. A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the notification  is successfully sent to the task doer. Then if the task doer doesn’t click the non-agreed upon button within the first 15% of the remaining time till the revision time is up or if the task doer sends the updated and completed task within the first 15% of the remaining time till the revision time is up , the non-agreed upon button will stop doing anything .Then  if the task doer sends to the bot the updated and the completed task before the revision time , the updated and the completed task  and a separate message (This message has an amharic version)  below it that has two button below it labeled as “Not Fixed” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Fixed” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator , the message lets the task creator know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has sent the updated and the completed task above, the message also lets them know that if everything is fixed in the updated and the completed task, they can click the Fixed button below, but if something is not fixed in the  the updated and the completed task , they can click the Not Fixed button below, the message will also let them know that they must click one of the two buttons below within 20 minutes or taskifii will take it as if  they(the task creator) clicked the fix button. And also a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator every 5 minutes for 20 minutes or until the task creator clicks either button  letting them know how much time they got to click any of the two buttons till their 20 minutes are up .  Then if the task creator clicks the Fixed button within 20 minutes or if the task creator doesn’t click any of the two buttons within 20 minutes , same thing will happen as if the continue button was clicked(read the whole instructions to understand) i.e the fixed button and the continue button have the same function when clicked(the only difference they have is their button label, and also as you will see, when the continue button is clicked, the continue button and the fix button will then stop doing anything if they get clicked, but in this case , the fixed button and the not fixed button are the ones that will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, but all the rest of the things are the same) . But if the task creator clicks the not fixed button , the fixed button and the not fixed button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked , then a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator letting them know that this case will be studied by taskifii, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii reaches out to them. A message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that the task creator has claimed that something was not fixed in the updated and the completed task ,  the  message will also let them know that this case will be studied by taskifii, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii reaches out to them.  Then both the task doer and the task creator will be banned from using the bot and the group.  Then the Task post without the apply button, the related file(if the task creator gave a related file) , the completed task the task doer sent first, the updated and completed task the task doer sent , the notification message (or something else) the task creator sent that let the task doer know what errors or mistakes to fix,  the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the  task creator’s phone number with emphasis, and the receipt the task creator sent will all be sent to another private channel that has a chat id of “-1002432632907” as one giant message that has  Five buttons attached below it labeled as “Contact Task Doer” , “Contact Task Creator”, “ keep blocking task doer”, “keep blocking task creator”, and “Completed” . And the giant message will have two hashtags in it saying “#Mistake” and “#UnCompleted”  .And if the contact task doer  button is clicked ,  it will take the user that clicked it, to the bot ,  and then  a message  will be sent to the user  through the bot  letting them know  that they should write a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then  if the user gives a message  or anything else,  it will be sent to the task doer.  But if the user clicks the contact task Creator button,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then a message will be sent to the user through the bot letting them know that they should write a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or anything else,  it would be sent to the task creator . 
 But  if the keep blocking task doer  button was clicked  by a user,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user  letting them know  that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task doer.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task doer later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task doer (i will explain how next) . Then  the bot  will send to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month” . And  then  if the user clicks  the day button , the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 days).  But if the user clicked the month button,  the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of months they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning  the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task doer is banned/kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task doer will then get 5 one-star reviews as if  5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task creator, the task creator  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator five-star reviews. Then in the giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task doer” (written in red color).  But if a user clicks the unblock task doer button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task doer . Then the bot will unban the task doer from the bot as well as the group.  But if a user clicked the keep blocking task creator button , it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task creator.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task creator later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task creator (i will explain how next). Then  the bot  will send  to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month”.  And then if the user clicks the day button , the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to keep on banning the task creator. Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 days). Then if the user gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier, then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task creator is kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task creator will then get 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task doer, the task doer  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-star reviews. Then in the then giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task creator” (written in Blue color). But if a user clicks the unblock task creator button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task creator . Then the bot will unban the task creator from the bot as well as the group. Okay but if the completed button is clicked , it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. I also want you to know that if the giant message will then have the text “The guilty is the task creator” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task creator button) and next time if the task creator clicks the not fixed button for another task for the for the second time  , the then giant message will  have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task creator”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task creator again” , then the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task doer [half the task fee they(the task creator) planned to pay the first victim task doer] birr and till they pay the second victimized task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) were supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr , the message will also include both of the task doer’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doers, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task doer) letting them know that taskifii has found the task creator guilty so the task creator [task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii  . And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task doer a message letting them know that a previous task creator they have worked with in the past by the name [task creator’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task creator) did to them (the task doer) in the past to another task doer , the message will also let them know that because the task creator repeated their mistake again , the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they pay half of the task fee they were supposed to pay them (the task doer) to them (the task doer) plus another corresponding task fee to the other task doer, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task creator sends the monetary punishment they (the task doer) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task creator to only click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task doer, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they send as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that they must now send the receipt of payment for the second victimized task doer. Then if the task creator gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will exactly wait till the first victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task doer the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version), and the message will let them know that a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name] has finally sent the punishment fee of [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the first victimized task doer] birr to them(the first victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will also wait exactly till the second victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then bot will send to the second victimized task doer the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “ I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task creator was supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr to them(the second victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will ban(or keep on banning) the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s telegram username, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to first victimized task doer], the task creator’s telegram username, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#FVTD” ,and “#mistake2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button (which i will explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (first victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews each as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task doer would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task doer clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (and obviously fyi ,this sent button will appear  if the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens with more details , for now just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message(This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because both the task doers have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. Then also the bot will give the task creator 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews and the bot will also give both the task doer 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creator gave the task doer five-stars.And btw ,I forgot to tell you that ,as soon as the first victimized task doer or the second victimized task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task doer would have clicked the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task doer  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then the second receipt , the second victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s telegram username,  the second victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis ,the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to second victimized task doer] birr,  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#SVTD” ,and “#mistake2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button  is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doers five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii.

Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task creator again” text in it  and if the task creator clicks the not fixed button for another task for the third time or more in the future , then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttc”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task creator is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttc button , the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e trying to make the task doer fix a mistake outside of the task description) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) was going to pay by the task doer] birr , the message will also include the task doer’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that after taskifii studied the case , the task creator has been found guilty so the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer). And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task creator to click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task creator) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt .

Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews.

Okay going back now, I also want you to know that if the giant message would have had the text “The guilty is the task doer” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task doer button) and next time if the task doer gets in the situation like this for the for the second time in the future (i.e in the future for the second time, if a task creator clicks the not fixed button for a task  the task doer worked on/ was working on)   , the then giant message  sent will have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task doer”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task doer again”,  then the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first or the former victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr and till they pay the second or the current victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task creator) letting them know that taskifii has found the task doer guilty so the task doer [task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee/ monetary punishment fee to them(the task creators), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii. And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task creator a message letting them know that a previous task doer they have worked with in the past by the name [task doer’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task doer) did to them (the task creator) in the past to another task creator(a.k.a the second victimized task creator) , the message will also let them know that because the task doer repeated their mistake again , the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half of the task fee they were supposed to get paid by  them (the task creator)initially  to them (the task creator) plus another corresponding monetary punishment fee to the other task creator, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task doer sends the monetary punishment fee they (the task creator) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt .

Then also when the second victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,  bot will send to the second victimized task creator the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator] birr to them(the second victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t, they must click the i deny button.

But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (this is ofcourse if the second victimized task creator clicked the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens, just know there is a sent button involved in it ) (btw the same goes vice versa i.e if a user clicked the sent button or if the second victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the first victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that because both the task creators have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the first victimized task creator or the second victimized task creator clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button,both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task creator  will be unbanned from the bot and the group, then  the second receipt , the second victimized task creator’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis ,the second victimized task creator’s telegram username ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee of the task the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator],  task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#SVTC” ,and “#mistake2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars each . Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task doer again” text in it  and if the task doer gets in the situation like this  for the third time or more in the future (i.e in the future for the third time or more, if a task creator clicks the not fixed button for a task the task doer worked on/was working on )  , then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttd”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task doer is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttd button , the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e not fixing the mistakes they made in the task in time) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the task creator] birr , the message will also include  task creator’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that after taskifii studied the case ,the task doer has been found guilty so the task doer  has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creator). And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task doer) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), when the task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , the bot will send to the task creator the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator] birr to them (the task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task creator’s name with emphasis ,the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#TC” ,and “#mistake3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because  the task creator have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task creator  clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 

If the task creator doesn’t click  the fix button or the continue button within the first 50% of the revision time or if the task creator  doesn’t send something to the bot within the first 50% of the revision time after clicking the fix button or if the task creator doesn’t click the accidental request button within the first 50% of the revision time after clicking the fix button or if the task creator clicks the continue button within the first 50% of the revision time , the accidental button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked(this is ofcourse if the task creator clicked the fix button but then after that ,did not either click the accidental request button within the first 50% of the revision time or send something to the bot with the first 50% of the revision time)   , then all the online banking details of the task doer , the task doer’s name , and a message (This message has an amharic version) below them will be sent to the task creator , the message will let the task creator know that they will choose the task doer’s online banking detail/s of their convenience above to send the task fee to them(the task doer) within exactly 30 minutes, the message will also let them know that after they send the money , they must send the the receipt here(to the bot) with in 30 minutes and that it doesn’t matter what format the receipt is (it can be a screenshot , pdf, link, ...etc…) . Then after all of this are sent to the task creator,  if the task creator sends something to the bot within 30 minutes,  whatever the task Creator sent to the bot  will be  sent to the task doer  with a message (This message has an amharic version)  and two buttons  attached below the message  labeled as “Approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Deny” (This button label has an amharic version),  the message  will let the task doer know that  the task creator has  claimed  that they ( the task creator)have sent  the task fee to  them (the task doer) ,  the message will also let them know that the task creator has sent  this file(whatever the task creator sent as a receipt)  as a proof that they have paid the task fee to them( the task  doer) ,  the message will also let them know that they must check if they have received the task fee  from the task creator  in which if they did , they can click the approve button below  but if they didn't receive any kind of task fee from the task creator,  they can click the deny button below, the message will also let them know that they got 5 minutes to click one of the buttons below otherwise taskifii will automatically assume that they (the task doer) have recieved the task fee so they must be quick to give an answer in 5 minutes, the message will also let them know that [the total birr amount deducted from the task fee before the task doer sent the completed task ] birr has been deducted from the task fee of [task fee] so they will get paid  [total birr amount deducted from the task fee before the task doer sent the completed task subtracted from the task fee] birr!. A message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the reciept has been successfully sent to the task doer , the message will also let them know that they must wait at most 5 minutes till the task doer confirms that they(the task doer) recieved the task fee.  And if the task doer clicks the approve button within the 5 minutes or if the task doer doesn’t click any of the two buttons within 5 minutes, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) with 5 buttons (This button label has an amharic version) attached below it (each labeled with star emoji that in which the color inside the star is not yellow but the color of the button meaning this “ ☆”, and the buttons must be arranged in one horizontal line in which every buttons are next to each other) to the task doer and the task creator, the message sent to the task doer will congratulate them in their success of finishing and delivering the completed task, the message will also thank them for doing their part , the message will also let them know that taskifii is happy to include  [the task doer’s name] as a trustworthy , responsible and valuable member of Taskifii , the message will also let them know that they have reached the final stage in which they have to rate the task creator [task creator’s name] from one star to five stars , the message will also let them know that it’s mandatory for them to rate the task creator before gaining access to use taskifii again, the message will also let them  that if they click the first star , it means  their experience with the task Creator was Very poor or unsatisfactory,  but if they click the second star button it means their experience with the task Creator was Poor or below expectations,  but if they click the Third star button it means their experience with the task Creator was Average or met expectations,  but if they click the fourth star button it means their experience with the task Creator was good or exceeded their expectations,  but if they click the 5th start button it means their experience with the task creator was excellent or outstanding, and the message sent to the task creator will congratulate them in their success of delegating a task, the message will also thank them for doing their part, the message will also let them know that taskifii is  happy to include them [the task creator’s name ] as a trustworthy and valuable member of taskifii,  the message will also let them know that they have reached the final stage in which they have to rate the task doer [task doer’s name] from one star to five stars , the message will also let them know that it’s mandatory for them to rate the task doer before gaining access to use taskifii again, the message will also let them that if they click the first star button , it means their experience with the task doer was Very poor or unsatisfactory,  but  if they click the second star button it means their experience with the task doer was Poor or below expectations,  but if they click the Third star button it means their experience with the task doer was Average or met expectations,  but if they click the fourth star button it means their experience with the task doer was good or exceeded their expectations,  but if they click the 5th star button it means their experience with the task doer was excellent or outstanding. Then If the task doer clicks one of the 5 buttons , the color of the inside part of the star in the button clicked will turn to yellow as well as the ones before it (this is ofcourse if there any before it i.e if the user clicks the first star button in the left of the user’s point of view , the only star in a button in which the color  inside of the star will change to yellow will only be the first one that was clicked on because there is nothing before it) , then the buttons will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then a message (This message has an amharic version) will  be sent to the task doer letting them know that they have successfully rated the task creator , the message will also let them know that taskifii hopes they(the task doer) have enjoyed using the taskifii. But if the task creator clicks one of the 5 buttons , the color of the inside part of the star in the button clicked will turn to yellow as well as the ones before it (this is ofcourse if there any i.e if the user clicks the first star button in the left of the user’s point of view , the only star in a button in which the color  inside of the star will change to yellow will only be the first one that was clicked on because there is nothing before it), then the buttons will stop doing anything if they get clicked,  a message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that they have successfully rated the task doer , the message will also let them know that taskifii hopes they(the task creator) have enjoyed using the taskifii. 

 But if the task doer clicks the deny button before the 5 minutes are up, a message (This message has an amharic version)  with two buttons attached below it labeled as “Give a Week” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Report to Taskifii” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task doer letting them know that sometimes it might be network reasons or transaction delay reasons  so if they want to give it a week till the money potentially arrives to their bank account ,  they can click the give a week button , the message will also let them know that if they click the give a week button , they and the task creator [the task creator’s name] won’t be able to use taskifii till they either recieve the taskfee (and notify taskifii that they recieved it) within a week or till the week is up in which taskifii will get to the bottom of this and punish the one who is found guilty , the message will also let them know that if they want the taskifii team to get to the bottom of this as soon as possible, they can click the report to taskifii button, the message will aslo let them know that the taskifii team is a bit busy with other reports like theirs so they shall wait till taskifii studies their case , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this and reaches out to them, the message will also warn them to click one of the buttons below within 5 minutes otherwise taskifii will assume that they recieved the task fee. And a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has denied that they have recieved the task fee so now they (the task creator) must wait to see if the task doer either wishes to wait a week to recieve the task fee or report this case to taskifii. Then if the task doer clicks the give a week button  ,  the give a week button and the report to taskifii button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked , then a message (This message has an amharic version) with two buttons attached below it labeled as “Received” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Report to Taskifii” (This button label has an amharic version) (yes, this button will do the same thing as the one before in which i will tell you later what it does if it gets clicked)   will be sent to the task doer letting them know that they must click the received button if they have received the task fee before the week is up, the message will also let them know that once the week is up and they haven’t clicked the received button , taskifii will study this case and give the right measurement to whomever is found guilty, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they recieve the task fee and click the recieved button within a week or till taskifii studies this case(if they clicked the report to taskifii button ). But i before i continue i want you to know that from earlier if it was a situation where the task doer doesn’t click the give a week button or the report to taskifii button next to it in time (the time i told you earlier) or even now if the task doer clicks the recieved button within a week (i know it’s confusing what i said but since both of these have the same result i decided to tell you what happens if either of the things happen), the buttons(if the task doer didn’t click the give a week button or the report to taskifii button within a week ,  the give a week button and the report to taskifii button is what i mean by buttons here  but if the task doer where in the stage where they clicked the recieved button within a week , the recieved button and the report to taskifii button next to it is what i mean by buttons here) will now stop doing anything if they get clicked , then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) with 5 buttons (This button label has an amharic version) attached below it (each labeled with star emoji that in which the color inside the star is not yellow but the color of the button meaning this “ ☆”, and the buttons must be arranged in one horizontal line in which every buttons are next to each other) to the task doer and the task creator, the message (This message has an amharic version)  sent to the task doer will congratulate them in their success of finishing and delivering the completed task, the message will also thank them for doing their part and using taskifii, the message will also let them know that taskifii is happy to include  [the task doer’s name] as a trustworthy , responsible and valuable member of Taskifii , the message will also let them know that they have reached the final stage in which they have to rate the task creator [task creator’s name] from one star to five stars , the message will also let them know that it’s mandatory for them to rate the task creator before gaining access to use taskifii again, the message will also let them  that if they click the first star , it means  their experience with the task Creator was Very poor or unsatisfactory,  but if they click the second star button it means their experience with the task Creator was Poor or below expectations,  but if they click the Third star button it means their experience with the task Creator was Average or met expectations,  but if they click the fourth star button it means their experience with the task Creator was good or exceeded their expectations,  but if they click the 5th start button it means their experience with the task creator was excellent or outstanding, and the message (This message has an amharic version)  sent to the task creator will congratulate them in their success of delegating a task, the message will also thank them for doing their part, the message will also let them know that taskifii is  happy to include them [the task creator’s name ] as a trustworthy and valuable member of taskifii,  the message will also let them know that they have reached the final stage in which they have to rate the task doer [task doer’s name] from one star to five stars , the message will also let them know that it’s mandatory for them to rate the task doer before gaining access to use taskifii again, the message will also let them that if they click the first star button , it means their experience with the task doer was Very poor or unsatisfactory,  but  if they click the second star button it means their experience with the task doer was Poor or below expectations,  but if they click the Third star button it means their experience with the task doer was Average or met expectations,  but if they click the fourth star button it means their experience with the task doer was good or exceeded their expectations,  but if they click the 5th star button it means their experience with the task doer was excellent or outstanding. Then If the task doer clicks one of the 5 buttons , the color of the inside part of the star in the button clicked will turn to yellow as well as the ones before it (this is ofcourse if there any before it i.e if the user clicks the first star button in the left of the user’s point of view , the only star in a button in which the color  inside of the star will change to yellow will only be the first one that was clicked on because there is nothing before it) , then the buttons will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then a message (This message has an amharic version) will  be sent to the task doer letting them know that they have successfully rated the task creator , the message will also let them know that taskifii hopes they(the task doer) have enjoyed using the taskifii. But if the task creator clicks one of the 5 buttons , the color of the inside part of the star in the button clicked will turn to yellow as well as the ones before it (this is ofcourse if there any i.e if the user clicks the first star button in the left of the user’s point of view , the only star in a button in which the color  inside of the star will change to yellow will only be the first one that was clicked on because there is nothing before it), then the buttons will stop doing anything if they get clicked,  a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that they have successfully rated the task doer , the message will also let them know that taskifii hopes they(the task creator) have enjoyed using the taskifii. But if the task doer would have clicked the report to taskifii button (either one i.e if the task doer clicked the report to taskifii button within 5 minutes rather than clicking the give a week button next to it within 5 minutes or if the task doer would have clicked the report to taskifii button within a week rather than clicking the recieved button next to it within a week ) or if the task doer would have not clicked the recieved button or the report to taskifii button next to it within a week , the buttons (if the task doer would have clicked the report to taskifii button next to the give a week button within the 5 minutes  ,  the give a week button and the report to taskifii button is what i mean by buttons here  but if the task doer where in the stage where they clicked the report to taskifii button next to the received button within a week , the recieved button and the report to taskifii button next to it is what i mean by buttons here)will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then  a message (This message has an amharic version)  will be sent  to the task doer letting them know that  taskifii has been notified about the report so they must wait till  taskifii studies this case and gets back to them(the task doers)  in which they(the task doer) can’t use taskifii till then . A message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has reported to taskifii that the task creator( in the message it will say “you”) did not send the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they shall wait till taskifii studies this case and gets back to them  in which they(the task creator) can’t use taskifii till then. Then the bot will ban the task doer and the task creator from using the bot as well as the group(the group i told you about earlier). Then the Task post without the apply button, the related file(if the task creator gave a related file) , the completed task the task doer sent, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the  task creator’s phone number with emphasis, and the receipt the task creator sent will all be sent to another private channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has  Five buttons attached below it labeled as “Contact Task Doer” , “Contact Task Creator”, “keep blocking task doer”, “keep blocking task creator”, and “Completed” . And the giant message will have two hashtags in it saying “#UnPaid” and “#UnCompleted” .  And if the contact task doer  button is clicked ,  it will take the user that clicked it, to the bot ,  and then  a message  will be sent to the user  through the bot  letting them know  that they should write a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then  if the user gives a message  or anything else,  it will be sent to the task doer.  But if the user clicks the contact task Creator button,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then a message will be sent to the user through the bot letting them know that they should write a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or anything else,  it would be sent to the task creator . 
 But  if the keep blocking task doer  button was clicked  by a user,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user  letting them know  that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task doer.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task doer later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task doer (i will explain how next) . Then  the bot  will send to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month” . And  then  if the user clicks  the day button , the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 days).  But if the user clicked the month button,  the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of months they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning  the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task doer is banned/kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task doer will then get 5 one-star reviews as if  5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task creator, the task creator  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator five-star reviews. Then in the giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task doer” (written in red color).  But if a user clicks the unblock task doer button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task doer . Then the bot will unban the task doer from the bot as well as the group.  But if a user clicked the keep blocking task creator button , it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task creator.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task creator later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task creator (i will explain how next). Then  the bot  will send  to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month”.  And then if the user clicks the day button , the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to keep on banning the task creator. Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 days). Then if the user gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier, then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task creator is kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task creator will then get 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task doer, the task doer  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-star reviews. Then in the then giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task creator” (written in Blue color). But if a user clicks the unblock task creator button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task creator . Then the bot will unban the task creator from the bot as well as the group. Okay but if the completed button is clicked , it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. I also want you to know that if the giant message will then have the text “The guilty is the task creator” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task creator button) and for the second time in the future, if the task creator gets the report to taskifii button clicked by a task doer on a task they posted , the then giant message will  have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task creator”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task creator again” , then the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task doer [half the task fee they(the task creator) planned to pay the first victim task doer] birr and till they pay the second victimized task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) were supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr , the message will also include both of the task doer’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doers, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task doer) letting them know that taskifii has found the task creator guilty so the task creator [task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii  . And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task doer a message letting them know that a previous task creator they have worked with in the past by the name [task creator’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task creator) did to them (the task doer) in the past to another task doer , the message will also let them know that because the task creator repeated their mistake again , the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they pay half of the task fee they were supposed to pay them (the task doer) to them (the task doer) plus another corresponding task fee to the other task doer, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task creator sends the monetary punishment they (the task doer) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task creator to only click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task doer, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they send as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that they must now send the receipt of payment for the second victimized task doer. Then if the task creator gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will exactly wait till the first victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task doer the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version), and the message will let them know that a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name] has finally sent the punishment fee of [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the first victimized task doer] birr to them(the first victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will also wait exactly till the second victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then bot will send to the second victimized task doer the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “ I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task creator was supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr to them(the second victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will ban(or keep on banning) the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s telegram username, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to first victimized task doer], the task creator’s telegram username, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#FVTD” ,and “#unpaid2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button (which i will explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (first victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews each as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task doer would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task doer clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (and obviously fyi ,this sent button will appear  if the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens with more details , for now just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message(This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because both the task doers have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. Then also the bot will give the task creator 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews and the bot will also give both the task doer 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creator gave the task doer five-stars.And btw ,I forgot to tell you that ,as soon as the first victimized task doer or the second victimized task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task doer would have clicked the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task doer  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then the second receipt , the second victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s telegram username,  the second victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis ,the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to second victimized task doer] birr,  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#SVTD” ,and “#unpaid2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button  is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doers five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii.

Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task creator again” text in it  and  for the third time or more in the future, if the task creator gets the report to taskifii button clicked by a task doer on a task they posted , then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttc”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task creator is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttc button , the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e making the task doer fix a mistake outside of the task description) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) was going to pay by the task doer] birr , the message will also include the task doer’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that after taskifii studied the case , the task creator has been found guilty so the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer). And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task creator to click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task creator) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt .

Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions.  And as i told you before, the task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews.

Okay going back now, I also want you to know that if the giant message would have had the text “The guilty is the task doer” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task doer button) and next time if the task doer gets in the situation like this for the for the second time in the future (i.e in the future for the second time, if the task doer clicks the report to taskifii button for another task)   , the then giant message  sent will have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task doer”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task doer again”,  then the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first or the former victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr and till they pay the second or the current victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task creator) letting them know that taskifii has found the task doer guilty so the task doer [task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee/ monetary punishment fee to them(the task creators), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii. And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task creator a message letting them know that a previous task doer they have worked with in the past by the name [task doer’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task doer) did to them (the task creator) in the past to another task creator(a.k.a the second victimized task creator) , the message will also let them know that because the task doer repeated their mistake again , the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half of the task fee they were supposed to get paid by  them (the task creator)initially  to them (the task creator) plus another corresponding monetary punishment fee to the other task creator, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task doer sends the monetary punishment fee they (the task creator) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that they must give the receipt of payment for the second victimized task creator . Then if the task doer gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will wait exactly till the first victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task creator the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr to them(the first victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then also when the second victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,  bot will send to the second victimized task creator the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator] birr to them(the second victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t, they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task creator’s name with emphasis ,the first victimized task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the first victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr,  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#FVTC” ,and “#unpaid2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the first victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist),  the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( first victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (this is ofcourse if the second victimized task creator clicked the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens, just know there is a sent button involved in it ) (btw the same goes vice versa i.e if a user clicked the sent button or if the second victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the first victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that because both the task creators have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the first victimized task creator or the second victimized task creator clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button,both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task creator  will be unbanned from the bot and the group, then  the second receipt , the second victimized task creator’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis ,the second victimized task creator’s telegram username ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee of the task the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator],  task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#SVTC” ,and “#unpaid2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars each . Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task doer again” text in it  and if the task doer gets in the situation like this  for the third time or more in the future (i.e in the future for the third time or more, if they click the report to taskifii button for another task), then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttd”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task doer is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttd button , the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has found them guilty by a situation(i.e for lying by saying i didn’t recieve the task fee) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the task creator] birr , the message will also include  task creator’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that after taskifii studied the case ,the task doer has been found guilty so the task doer  has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creator). And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task doer) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), when the task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , the bot will send to the task creator the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator] birr to them (the task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task creator’s name with emphasis ,the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#TC” ,and “#unpaid3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because  the task creator have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task creator  clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. And if the task doer would have clicked the non-agreed upon button before the time to click the non-agreed upon button was up, a message with a button attached below it labeled as “Cancel this report” will be sent to the task doer letting them know that they should send a message that explains atleast one thing that is a non agreed upon work outside of the task description that the task creator insisted them(the task doer) to fix in the completed task, the message will also let them know that they got 5 minutes to send the message or they won’t get another chance to report this. Then if the task doer doesn’t send a message within 5 minutes or if the task doer clicks the cancel this report button within 5 minutes   , the cancel this report button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked , then the bot will wait till the task doer sends the updated and completed task before the revision time is up, in which if they do or not , the exact same thing or process will happen as i told earlier (i.e the process  i told you of what happens if the task doer sends the updated and completed task before the revision time is up rather than clicking the non agreed upon button ).  But if the task doer would have sent a message or something to the bot within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button ,  the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has claimed that the task creator (in the message it will say “you”) is insisting them(the task doer) to fix something that is a non agreed upon extra work outside of the task description,  the message will also let them know that taskifii will get to the bottom of this and punish the one who is found guilty, the message will also let the task creator know that the taskifii team has a lot complaints like this to resolve so it might take a while till taskifii studies this case , the message will also let them know that they (the task creator) can’t unfortunately use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this.  And also from the task doer side a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent letting them know that they have successfully sent the report claim to taskifii, the message will also let them know that they shall wait till taskifii team studies this case and gets to the bottom of it , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this. Then both the task doer and the task creator will be banned from using both the group and this bot until i can study this case and confirm the one who is guilty and the way this happens is once the task doer gives a message or anything within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button , the message or something the task creator sent within first 50% of the revision time after clicking the fix button , the message the task doer sent within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button , the related file (if there is any), the task post without the apply button, the task doer’s name with emphasis ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, and the  task creator’s phone number with emphasis will all be sent to another channel (which has the chat id :--1002432632907) as one giant message(which will have two hashtags in it saying “#nonagreedupon” and “#UnCompleted”) with seven buttons  attached below it labeled as “Contact Task Doer” , “Contact Task Creator”, “ keep blocking task doer”, “keep blocking task creator”, “Unblock task doer”, “Unblock Task creator” and “Completed” .  And if the contact task doer  button is clicked ,  it will take the user that clicked it, to the bot ,  and then  a message  will be sent to the user  through the bot  letting them know  that they should write a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then  if the user gives a message  or anything else,  it will be sent to the task doer.  But if the user clicks the contact task Creator button,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then a message will be sent to the user through the bot letting them know that they should write a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or anything else,  it would be sent to the task creator . 
 But  if the keep blocking task doer  button was clicked  by a user,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user  letting them know  that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task doer.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task doer later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task doer (i will explain how next) . Then  the bot  will send to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month” . And  then  if the user clicks  the day button , the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 days).  But if the user clicked the month button,  the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of months they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning  the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task doer is banned/kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task doer will then get 5 one-star reviews as if  5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task creator, the task creator  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator five-star reviews. Then in the giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task doer” (written in red color).  But if a user clicks the unblock task doer button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task doer . Then the bot will unban the task doer from the bot as well as the group.  But if a user clicked the keep blocking task creator button , it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task creator.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task creator later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task creator (i will explain how next). Then  the bot  will send  to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month”.  And then if the user clicks the day button , the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to keep on banning the task creator. Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 days). Then if the user gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier, then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task creator is kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task creator will then get 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task doer, the task doer  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-star reviews. Then in the then giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task creator” (written in Blue color). But if a user clicks the unblock task creator button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task creator . Then the bot will unban the task creator from the bot as well as the group. Okay but if the completed button is clicked , it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. I also want you to know that if the giant message will then have the text “The guilty is the task creator” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task creator button) and for the second time ,if the task creator gets a non agreed upon report from a task doer in the future (i.e if task doer sends a message within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button) , the giant message will then have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task creator”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task creator again” , then the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task doer [half the task fee they(the task creator) planned to pay the first victim task doer] birr and till they pay the second victimized task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) were supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr , the message will also include both of the task doer’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doers, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task doer will be un banned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task doer) letting them know that taskifii has found the task creator guilty so the task creator [task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii  . And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task doer a message letting them know that a previous task creator they have worked with in the past by the name [task creator’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task creator) did to them (the task doer) in the past to another task doer , the message will also let them know that because the task creator repeated their mistake again , the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they pay half of the task fee they were supposed to pay them (the task doer) to them (the task doer) plus another corresponding task fee to the other task doer, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task creator sends the monetary punishment they (the task doer) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task creator to only click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task doer, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they send as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that they must now send the receipt of payment for the second victimized task doer. Then if the task creator gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will exactly wait till the first victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task doer the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version), and the message will let them know that a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name] has finally sent the punishment fee of [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the first victimized task doer] birr to them(the first victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will also wait exactly till the second victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then bot will send to the second victimized task doer the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “ I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task creator was supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr to them(the second victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will ban(or keep on banning) the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s telegram username, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to first victimized task doer], the task creator’s telegram username, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#FVTD” ,and “#nonagreedupon2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button (which i will explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (first victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews each as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task doer would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task doer clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (and obviously fyi ,this sent button will appear  if the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens with more details , for now just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message(This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because both the task doers have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. Then also the bot will give the task creator 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews and the bot will also give both the task doer 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creator gave the task doer five-stars.And btw ,I forgot to tell you that ,as soon as the first victimized task doer or the second victimized task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task doer would have clicked the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task doer  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then the second receipt , the second victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s telegram username,  the second victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis ,the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to second victimized task doer] birr,  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#SVTD” ,and “#nonagreedupon2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button  is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doers five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task creator again” text in it  and for the third time or more ,if the task creator gets a non agreed upon report from a task doer in the future (i.e for the third time or more in the future , if a task doer sends a message within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button for a task), then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttc”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task creator is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttc button , the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e trying to make the task doer fix a mistake that wasn’t theirs) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) was going to pay by the task doer] birr , the message will also include the task doer’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that after taskifii studied the case , the task creator has been found guilty so the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer). And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task creator to click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task creator) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt .

Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions.

Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews.

Okay going back now, I also want you to know that if the giant message would have had the text “The guilty is the task doer” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task doer button) and for the second time  ,if the task doer gives a non agreed upon report in in the future (i.e for the second time in the future , if the task doer sends a message within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button) , the then giant message  sent will have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task doer”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task doer again”,  then the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first or the former victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr and till they pay the second or the current victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task creator) letting them know that taskifii has found the task doer guilty so the task doer [task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee/ monetary punishment fee to them(the task creators), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii. And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task creator a message letting them know that a previous task doer they have worked with in the past by the name [task doer’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task doer) did to them (the task creator) in the past to another task creator(a.k.a the second victimized task creator) , the message will also let them know that because the task doer repeated their mistake again , the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half of the task fee they were supposed to get paid by  them (the task creator)initially  to them (the task creator) plus another corresponding monetary punishment fee to the other task creator, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task doer sends the monetary punishment fee they (the task creator) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt .

And btw , as soon as the first victimized task creator or the second victimized task creator clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button,both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task creator  will be unbanned from the bot and the group, then  the second receipt , the second victimized task creator’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis ,the second victimized task creator’s telegram username ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee of the task the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator],  task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”.

Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars each . Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task doer again” text in it  and for the third time or more ,if the task doer gives a non agreed upon report  in the future (i.e for the third time or morein the future , if the task doer sends a message within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button for a task), then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttd”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task doer is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttd button , the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e lying by saying that the task creator insisted them(the task doer) fix a mistake that wasn’t theirs to fix) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the task creator] birr , the message will also include  task creator’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that after taskifii studied the case ,the task doer has been found guilty so the task doer  has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creator). And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task doer) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), when the task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , the bot will send to the task creator the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator] birr to them (the task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task creator’s name with emphasis ,the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#TC” ,and “#nonagreedupon3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because  the task creator have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task creator  clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed.  And if the task doer clicks the non agreed upon button and doesn’t send a message within 5 minutes after clicking it  or if the task doer clicks the cancel this report button within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button , as i told you before the non agreed upon button will then after stop doing anything if it gets clicked ,then the bot will wait till the task doer sends the updated and completed task within revision time in which if they do , the same thing will happen next as if the continue button was clicked (but i want point out that if the task doer would have initially sent the completed task after the time is up , if clicked, the continue button would lead something slight different rather than the continue button that exists if the task doer would have sent the completed task within the time given for the task i.e the task fee becomes less if the task doer sent the completed task after the time given for the task is up and that is ofcourse if till the task fee reaches zero that task doer has a chance to send the completed task(i explained this earlier), so please know which continue button to adjust to the situation). But if the task doer wouldn’t have sent the updated and the completed task within the revision time(don’t forget what i told you earlier!,  this also includes the time after the task doer clicked the non agreed upon button in time but didn’t send a message to the bot within 5 minutes after clicking it), the same thing will happen as if the task doer wouldn’t have sent the completed task at all,  even within the time given for the task or even after that (i.e till task fee reaches zero) (in which i have explained this part somewhere in this instruction).    

 

 Okay now moving on, i forgot to tell you that If the task Doer would have sent the completed task within the time given to finish and submit the completed task,  firstly the  violation button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked(if the completed task was sent before the time to click the violation button was up),  then the same thing would happen as if the task doer would have sent the completed task after the time given for the task was up but before the task fee reached zero (in which i explain somewhere in this instructions).  
 And also if the task creator doesn’t click both the fix button  & the continue button within the first 50% of the revision time or if the task creator  doesn’t send a message to the bot(or also click the accidental request button) after clicking the fix button  within the first 50% of the revision time  or if the task creator clicks the continue button within the first 50% of the revision time , the fix button, the continue button and the accidental button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then all the online banking details of the task doer , the task doer’s name , and a message (This message has an amharic version) below them will be sent to the task creator , the message will let the task creator know that they will choose the task doer’s online banking detail/s of their convenience above to send the task fee to them(the task doer) within 30 minutes, the message will also let them know that after they send the money , they must send the the receipt here(to the bot) and that it doesn’t matter what format the receipt is (it can be a screenshot , pdf,...etc…) . Then after all of this are sent to the task creator,  if the task creator sends something to the bot within 30 minutes,  whatever the task Creator sent to the bot  will be  sent to the task doer  with a message (This message has an amharic version)  and two buttons  attached below the message  labeled as “Approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Deny” (This button label has an amharic version),  the message  will let the task doer know that  the task creator has  claimed  that they ( the task creator)have sent  the task fee to  them (the task doer) ,  the message will also let them know that the task creator has sent  this file(whatever the task creator sent as a receipt)  as a proof that they have paid the task fee to them( the task  doer) ,  the message will also let them know that they must check if they have received the task fee  from the task creator  in which if they did  they can click the approve button below  but if they didn't receive any kind of task fee from the task creator,  they can click the deny button below, the message will also let them know that they got 5 minutes to click one of the buttons below otherwise taskifii will automatically assume that they (the task doer) have recieved the task fee so they must be quick to give an answer in 5 minutes. And if the task doer clicks the approve button within the 5 minutes or if the task doer doesn’t click any of the two buttons within 5 minutes, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  with 5 buttons (This button label has an amharic version) attached below it (each labeled with star emoji that in which the color inside the star is not yellow but the color of the button meaning this “ ☆”, and the buttons must be arranged in one horizontal line in which every buttons are next to each other) to the task doer and the task creator, the message (This message has an amharic version)  sent to the task doer will congratulate them in their success of finishing and delivering the completed task, the message will also thank them for doing their part , the message will also let them know that taskifii is happy to include them [the task doer’s name] as trustworthy and responsible member of Taskifii , the message will also let them know that they have reached the final stage in which they have to rate the task creator [task creator’s name] from one star to five stars , the message will also let them know that it’s mandatory for them to rate the task creator before gaining access to use taskifii again, the message will also let them  that if we click the first star , it means  their experience with the task Creator was Very poor or unsatisfactory,  but  if they click the second star button it means their experience with the task Creator was Poor or below expectations,  but if they click the Third star button it means their experience with the task Creator was Average or met expectations,  but if they click the fourth star button it means their experience with the task Creator was good or exceeded their expectations,  but if they click the 5th start button it means their experience with the task creator was excellent or outstanding, and the message (This message has an amharic version) sent to the task creator will congratulate them in their success of delegating a task, the message will also thank them for doing their part, the message will also let them know that taskifii is  happy to include them [the task creator’s name ] as a trustworthy member of taskifii,  the message will also let them know that they have reached the final stage in which they have to rate the task doer [task doer’s name] from one star to five stars , the message will also let them know that it’s mandatory for them to rate the task doer before gaining access to use taskifii again, the message will also let them that if they click the first star button , it means their experience with the task doer was Very poor or unsatisfactory,  but  if they click the second star button it means their experience with the task doer was Poor or below expectations,  but if they click the Third star button it means their experience with the task doer was Average or met expectations,  but if they click the fourth star button it means their experience with the task doer was good or exceeded their expectations,  but if they click the 5th star button it means their experience with the task doer was excellent or outstanding. Then If the task doer clicks one of the buttons , the color of inside of the star in the button clicked will turn to yellow as well as the ones before it , the buttons will stop doing anything if they get clicked,  a message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that they have successfully rated the task creator , the message will also let them know that taskifii hopes they(the task doer) have enjoyed using the taskifii. But if the task creator clicks one of the buttons , the color of inside of the star in the button clicked will turn to yellow as well as the ones before it (if there any i.e if the user clicks the first star button, the only star in a button in which the color  inside of the star will change to yellow will only be the first one that was clicked on), then the buttons will stop doing anything if they get clicked,  a message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that they have successfully rated the task doer , the message will also let them know that taskifii hopes they(the task creator) have enjoyed using the taskifii. 
And btw i forgot to tell you that if the task doer wouldn’t have sent the completed task at all,  even within the time given for the task or even after that (i.e till task fee reaches zero) or if the task doer wouldn’t have sent the updated and completed task within 50% of the revision time, a message will be sent to the task doer letting them know that they have been banned from taskifii for 5 months for not meeting their obligations, the message will also let them know that if they repeat this action again , there will be some monetary punishment to pay. Then the bot will ban the task doer from the bot and the group for 5 months. Then after the 5 months are up (i.e after the task doer is no longer banned from the bot and the group), the Bot will send a message to the task doer letting them know that they can now start using taskifii ,  the message will also let them know that they should be careful in not repeating this action again otherwise next time there would be monetary punishments to pay. If the task doer repeats this mistake for the second time again i.e not send the completed task at all (i.e if they don’t send the completed task neither within the time given for the task nor after that ,till task fee reaches zero),  the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victim task creator] birr and till they pay the second victim task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victim task creator and the second task creator letting them know that the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creators). And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that they must give the receipt of payment for the second victimized task creator . Then if the task doer gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) and when the first victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , the bot will send to the first victimized task creator the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr to them(the first victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then also when the second victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,  bot will send to the second victimized task creator the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator] birr to them(the second victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t, they must click the i deny button.

If the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task creator’s name with emphasis ,the first victimized task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the first victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator],  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#FVTC” ,and “#undelivered2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the first victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions.

Moving on , if the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task creator  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then  the second receipt , the second victimized task creator’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis ,the second victimized task creator’s telegram username ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee of the task the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator],  task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”.

If the task doer repeats this mistake ( i.e not send the completed task at all (i.e if they don’t send the completed task neither within the time given for the task nor after that ,till task fee reaches zero) ) for the third time or more, the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has completed studying the case and taskifii has found them guilty by a situation like this for the third time or more (i.e not sending the completed task at all ( neither within the time given for the task nor after that ,till task fee reaches zero) for the third time or more ) so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the task creator] birr , the message will also include  task creator’s name(with emphasis) and all their (the task creator’s) banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creator). And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task doer) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), when the task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , the bot will send to the task creator the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator] birr to them (the task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task creator’s name with emphasis ,the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#TC” ,and “#undelivered3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because  the task creator have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task creator  clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 




Now moving on, If the task had the 50:50 payment-task exchange strategy on it and if a accepted task doer clicks the do the task button, a message (This message has an amharic version) that might also include a button attached below it labeled as “Violation” (This button label has an amharic version) (this button will only exist if the the task creator gave a related file earlier in the task inquiry format and also in which if they did, the related file the task creator gave earlier will be attached above the message ) will be sent to the task doer letting them know that they have to now start doing the task, the message will also let them know that they have [ the time given to complete task] to finish and submit the first 50% of the completed task here (in the bot), the message will also let them know that it will be recommended if  they can first send the first 50% of the completed task within [the first 50% of the time given for the task]. And if there is a related file , the message will also let them know that the task creator also gave the file above that have a  relation to the task ,  the message will also let them know that if the related  file has some other instructions or more work for them to do that is outside the task description, they can choose not to do it by reporting(i like to call it a violation report) it to taskifii  by clicking the violation button below, The message will also let them know that if they click the violation button, they will give a reason why , then the issue will be studied by taskifii and if there is no problem found(meaning if the related file doesn’t have more  instructions or work not described in the task description)  , they will be strictly banned from using taskifii for a while plus if they do the same mistake again next time , there would be a monetary punishment to pay to use taskifii again, the message will also let them know that if they intend to click the violation button , they have to click it within [15% of the time given for the task ]. I will tell you what will happens if the violation button is clicked or not clicked but for now let’s move on. I want you to know that  after the do the task button is clicked ,the bot will also change a couple of details about the task post and that is that the text “Task is open!”  in the above section of the task post in the channel will change to “Task is taken!” (written in the ink color told you earlier) and also the apply button will disappear from the task post in the channel and also the accept & decline buttons of all apply posts the task creator has already received will disappear . And also all incoming apply posts will be canceled and also A message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to all the rest of the task doers that  applied and got accepted but didn’t click the do the task button before the first task doer that clicked the do the task button  letting them apologetically know that the task is taken by another task doer that clicked the do the task button quicker than them and they should have better luck and speed next time if they want to have a better chance, the message will also let them know that they should find other tasks to do . A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to all the rest of the task doers that applied but didn’t get neither accepted nor declined and all the rest of  task doers that were applying(i.e if they were in the application format(which will also cancel the application format)) letting them apologetically know that the task creator has chosen another task doer to do the task so they should move on and find other tasks to do. And all the rest  of  task doers that were applying(i.e if they were in the application format) only for this will have their application format stop doing anything(essentially meaning the application process or format will be canceled because the task creator already found a task doer) and if there were buttons in their stage of application format, the buttons will now stop doing anything if they get clicked. Moving on, after  the do the task button was clicked ,  The do the task button and the cancel button from earlier will also now  stop doing anything (if they get clicked) for all the task doers that got accepted including the one that clicked the do the task button first. And also if more than one  accepted task doers clicks the do the task button at exactly the same time, the bot will randomly choose one of them as the one that clicked the do the task button first.  And also the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has begun doing the task , the message will also let them know that if the task doer sends the completed task , it will then be sent to them(the task creators) here through the bot ,  the message will also let them know  that the task doer has [time given for the task] to finish the task. And also on the task doers side , the bot will make the violation button stop doing anything when clicked if no one clicks it before 15% of the time given for the task has passed , not only this but if the time has passed (i.e after the first 15% of the time given for the task has passed) and if the task doer clicks the violation button after the time has passed , only for the first click, a message (This message has an amharic version)  will be sent to the task doer letting them know that their time to click the violation button is up so they should finish doing the task and submit it within the time given.  But then If the task doer clicks the violation button in time, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  with a button attached below it  labeled as “ Cancel Report” (This button label has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them  know taskifii will get to the bottom of this but taskifii needs their (the task doer’s ) help by telling taskifii at least one thing in the related file (or the file the task creator attached to the task) that creates more work not described in the task description,  the message  will  also let them know  that they got 5 minutes to give that  reason or more , otherwise they will be obligated to complete the task,  the message will also let them know that the 5 minutes is a part of the time given to finish and submit the task so they must be sure about it , the message will also let them know that if they are not sure about it and want to change their idea, they can click the Cancel report button below quickly ,The message will also let them know that once they click the cancel report button ,there's no going Back  meaning no more  getting a chance  to report something in the related file that causes more work not described in task description. 
And then if the task doer sends a message or something within 5 minutes , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has claimed that the task creator (in the message it will say “you”) has included non agreed upon extra work in the file  that the task creator  (in the message it will say “you”)  attached , the message will also let them know that taskifii will get to the bottom of this and punish the one who is found guilty, the message will also let the task creator know that the taskifii team has a lot complaints like this to resolve so  it might take a while til taskifii studies this case , the message will also let them know that they (the task creator) can’t unfortunately use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this.  And also from the task doer side a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent letting them know that they have successfully sent the violation report to taskifii, the message will also let them know that they shall wait till taskifii team studies this case and gets to the bottom of it , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this. Then both the task doer and the task creator will be banned from using both the group (which has this chat id: “-1002239730204”)( and btw  later on ,if i say group , i mean this group with this chat id) and this bot until i can study this case and confirm the one who is guilty and the way this happens is once the task doer gives a message or anything within 5 minutes after clicking the violation button(which we have discussed earlier) , the related file, the task post without the apply button, the task doer’s name with emphasis ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the  task creator’s phone number with emphasis,  and  the message or whatever the task doer sent to the bot within 5 minutes after clicking the violation button will all be sent to another channel (which has the chat id :--1002432632907) as one giant message(which will have two hashtags in it saying “#Violation” and “#UnCompleted”) with seven buttons  attached below it labeled as “Contact Task Doer” , “Contact Task Creator”, “ keep blocking task doer”, “keep blocking task creator”, “Unblock task doer”, “Unblock Task creator” and “Completed” .  And if the contact task doer  button is clicked ,  it will take the user that clicked it, to the bot ,  and then  a message  will be sent to the user  through the bot  letting them know  that they should write a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then  if the user gives a message  or anything else,  it will be sent to the task doer.  But if the user clicks the contact task Creator button,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then a message will be sent to the user through the bot letting them know that they should write a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or anything else,  it would be sent to the task creator . 
 But  if the keep blocking task doer  button was clicked  by a user,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user  letting them know  that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task doer.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task doer later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task doer (i will explain how next) . Then  the bot  will send to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month” . And  then  if the user clicks  the day button , the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 days).  But if the user clicked the month button,  the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of months they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning  the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task doer is banned/kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task doer will then get 5 one-star reviews as if  5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task creator, the task creator  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator five-star reviews. Then in the giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task doer” (written in red color).  But if a user clicks the unblock task doer button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task doer . Then the bot will unban the task doer from the bot as well as the group.  But if a user clicked the keep blocking task creator button , it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task creator.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task creator later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task creator (i will explain how next). Then  the bot  will send  to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month”.  And then if the user clicks the day button , the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to keep on banning the task creator. Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 days). Then if the user gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier, then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task creator is kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task creator will then get 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task doer, the task doer  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-star reviews. Then in the then giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task creator” (written in Blue color). But if a user clicks the unblock task creator button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task creator . Then the bot will unban the task creator from the bot as well as the group. Okay but if the completed button is clicked , it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. I also want you to know that if the giant message will then have the text “The guilty is the task creator” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task creator button) and next time if the task creator gets a violation report for the second time , the giant message will then have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task creator”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task creator again” , then the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task doer [half the task fee they(the task creator) planned to pay the first victim task doer] birr and till they pay the second victimized task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) were supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr , the message will also include both of the task doer’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doers, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task doer will be un banned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task doer) letting them know that taskifii has found the task creator guilty so the task creator [task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii  . And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task doer a message letting them know that a previous task creator they have worked with in the past by the name [task creator’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task creator) did to them (the task doer) in the past to another task doer , the message will also let them know that because the task creator repeated their mistake again , the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they pay half of the task fee they were supposed to pay them (the task doer) to them (the task doer) plus another corresponding task fee to the other task doer, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task creator sends the monetary punishment they (the task doer) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task creator to only click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task doer, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they send as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that they must now send the receipt of payment for the second victimized task doer. Then if the task creator gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will exactly wait till the first victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task doer the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version), and the message will let them know that a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name] has finally sent the punishment fee of [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the first victimized task doer] birr to them(the first victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will also wait exactly till the second victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then bot will send to the second victimized task doer the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “ I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task creator was supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr to them(the second victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will ban(or keep on banning) the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s telegram username, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to first victimized task doer], the task creator’s telegram username, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#FVTD” ,and “#violationguilty2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button (which i will explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (first victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews each as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task doer would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task doer clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (and obviously fyi ,this sent button will appear  if the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens with more details , for now just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message(This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because both the task doers have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. Then also the bot will give the task creator 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews and the bot will also give both the task doer 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creator gave the task doer five-stars.And btw ,I forgot to tell you that ,as soon as the first victimized task doer or the second victimized task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task doer would have clicked the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task doer  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then the second receipt , the second victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s telegram username,  the second victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis ,the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to second victimized task doer] birr,  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#SVTD” ,and “#violationguilty2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button  is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doers five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task creator again” text in it  and if the task creator gets the violation report for the third time or more in the future , then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttc”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task creator is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttc button , the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e adding non agreed upon extra work in the related file) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) was going to pay by the task doer] birr , the message will also include the task doer’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that after taskifii studied the case , the task creator has been found guilty so the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer). And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task creator to click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task creator) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), the bot will exactly wait till the task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,then the bot will send to the task doer the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the task doer] birr to them (the task doer), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task doer’s name with emphasis ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the task creator’s name with emphasis, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task creator’s email address with emphasis, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#TD” ,and “#violationreport3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because  the task doer have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then also the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii.

And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 



Okay going back now, I also want you to know that if the giant message would have had the text “The guilty is the task doer” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task doer button) and next time if the task doer gives a violation report for the second time again  (i.e by clicking the violation button and then sending a message within 5 minutes) , the giant message  sent will have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task doer”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task doer again”,  then the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first or the former victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr and till they pay the second or the current victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task creator) letting them know that taskifii has found the task doer guilty so the task doer [task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee/ monetary punishment fee to them(the task creators), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii. And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task creator a message letting them know that a previous task doer they have worked with in the past by the name [task doer’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task doer) did to them (the task creator) in the past to another task creator(a.k.a the second victimized task creator) , the message will also let them know that because the task doer repeated their mistake again , the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half of the task fee they were supposed to get paid by  them (the task creator)initially  to them (the task creator) plus another corresponding monetary punishment fee to the other task creator, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task doer sends the monetary punishment fee they (the task creator) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that they must give the receipt of payment for the second victimized task creator . Then if the task doer gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will wait exactly till the first victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task creator the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr to them(the first victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then also when the second victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,  bot will send to the second victimized task creator the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator] birr to them(the second victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t, they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task creator’s name with emphasis ,the first victimized task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the first victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr,  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”.

Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because  the task creator have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task creator  clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 







       






 Okay going back now , i want you to know that after the task doer clicked the violation button, the bot will also keep on sending a separate message (This message has an amharic version)  every minute till the task doer either clicks the cancel report button within 5 minutes or till the task doer sends a message or something within 5 minutes or till the 5 minutes are up, and the message will essentially let them know how much time they got to send a message. 
But If the task doer doesn’t send a message or something within the 5 minutes after clicking the violation button, a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task doer letting them know that their time to give the message or violation report is up, the message will also let them know that they have to now only send the completed task or proof of task completion here to the bot  within[the remaining time till the time given for the task is up].Then  the cancel report button will stop doing anything if it gets clicked . Then the bot will wait for the task doer to send the completed task within the remaining time til the time given for the task is up(in which i will tell you later what happens if this happens or not) (and the bot will also do this if the task doer doesn’t click the violation button). And btw if you didn’t know by now,  as soon as the task doer clicked the do the task button,  in perfect circumstances(i.e if the task doer didn’t click the violation button and then send a message within 5 minutes after clicking it) ,the bot will wait for the task doer to send the completed task/50% of it  to the bot within the time given for the task.
 And before i tell you what happens if the task doer  sends the completed task in time , i will first tell you What happens if the task Doer doesn’t send the task within the time given to  complete and submit the task(i.e. time given for task). But before i tell you it , i want you to know that the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer every 20% of the remaining time after the first 45% of the time given for the task has gone by, and the message will let the task doer know that they got [the remaining till the time given for the task is up] to submit the first 50% of the completed task to the bot so that they must send the first 50% of the task quickly. But the bot will only keep on sending this message to the task doer till either  the task doer sends the completed task to the bot within the time given for the task or till the time given for the task is up .   Okay moving on, If the task doer doesn’t send the completed task/the first 50% of the completed task within the time given for the task , an alertful message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task doer every 20% of the remaining time til the task fee reaches zero amount (sorry for confusing you, the reason why task fee will reach zero amount is because the birr amount deducted per hour from the task fee(the task creator would have given this earlier in task inquiry format) will start being deducted from the task fee every hour once the task doer missed the chance to send the completed within the time given to do the task) and the messages will be kept on being sent to the task doer til either the task doer sends the completed task or 50% of it within the remaining time till task fee reaches zero amount or till the task fee reaches zero, the message will warn them that they were late to submit the completed task so starting from the current time  [birr amount deducted  per hour from task fee] birr  (the task creator gave this  earlier in the task inquiry format) will be deducted from their task fee till either the task fee reaches zero birr amount or til they send the first 50% of the completed task, the message will also let them know that if the task fee reaches zero amount before they submit the first 50% of the completed task to the bot, they will be banned from using taskifii for 5 months and if they repeat this mistake again, there would be a monetary punishment to use taskifii again i.e they will pay half the task fee to the former victim task creator and the new victim task creator, the message  will also let them know that they got [the remaining time til the task fee reaches zero] to submit the task . 
And also an alertful message (This message has an amharic version)  will be sent to the task creator every 20% of the remaining time til the task fee reaches zero amount (the reason why it will reach zero amount is because the birr amount deducted per hour from the task fee (the task creator would have given this earlier) will start being deducted from the task fee every hour once the task doer missed the chance to send the completed task  with in the time given to do the task and til either the task doer sends the completed task within the remaining time till task fee reaches zero amount or till the task fee reaches zero amount) , and the message let’s them know that the task doer hasn’t  delivered the completed task within the time given for the task , the message will also let them know that  [ the birr amount deducted per hour from task fee] birr will be deducted from the task fee every hour till either the task fee reaches zero amount or til the task doer sends the first 50% of the completed task before the task fee reaches zero amount. 
Okay then if the task doer sends the completed task before the task fee reaches zero amount , firstly the bot pause the time till task fee reaches zero amount(i will tell you when it will resume) ,then the first 50% of the completed task the task doer sent  would be sent to the task creator with a message (This message has an amharic version) attached  below it  and the message will have two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Fix” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Continue” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that the task doer has sent this 50% of the completed task to them,  the message will also let them know that they must check for any errors or mistakes  made by the task doer,  the message will also let them  that if they find  an   error or mistake  made by the task Doer ,they(the task creator) can notify and make the task Doer  fix whatever the error or mistake they(the task doer) made,  the message will also let them know that they got [the first 25% of the Revision Time] (the task doer gave earlier in the task inquiry) to click the fix button and give a message that will be sent to the  task doer to fix any mistakes they might have made ,  the message will also let them know that  the  task doer  will fix the mistakes  and send the updated  completed task within [the remaining time til 50% of the revision time is up ], the  message will also let them know that if they click  the  continue button  it means that there is no error or mistake in the completed task the task doer sent ,  the message will also let them know that if they click the continue button,  it means  that they they want to move on ,  the message will also let them know  that if they don't click the fix button within [the first 25% of the revision time] , it's going to be taken as the completed task sent has no error or mistakes in it.  And also while this message is being sent to task creator, another message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task doer  letting them know that they have successfully sent 50% of the completed task,  the message will also let them know that the task Creator is reviewing and checking for any kind of errors or mistakes they(the task doer) might have made,  the message will also let them know that the task creator has [the first 25% of the revision time] to notify them(the task doers) about any kind of errors or mistakes they(the task doers) might have made so that they (task doers)can quickly fix them and send the updated ,correct and  completed task here (to the bot), the message will also let the task doer know that they must  wait attentively for at most [the first 25% of the revision time] til/ if the task creator notifies about a potential mistake or error they (the task doer) must fix so that they(the task doer) can use their remaining time effectively til the time given to send the updated and completed task is up  . Then after both this messages is sent to the receivers  , and then  if the task creator clicks the fix button  before the first 25% of the revision time has passed, a message (This message has an amharic version)  with a button attached below it labeled as “Accidental Request” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator letting them know that they should write  one message letting the task doer know every mistakes & errors they(the task doer) must fix, the message will also let them know that they must make everything clear for the task doer to understand , the message will also let them know that they got [the remaining time til the first 25% of the revision time is up] to send the message here(to the bot), the message will also let them know that if they click the accidental request button, it means they changed their minds to understanding that the 50% of the completed task doesn’t have any errors or mistakes. Before i continue , i forgot to tell you that a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator every 20 % of the first 25% of the revision time  till they either click the fix button or the continue button , and the message let’s them know how much time they got to click the fix button and notify the task doer any errors or mistakes to fix if there is any,  the message will also let them know that if they click the continue button before [the remaining time til the first 25% of the revision time is up] or if they don’t click any of the two buttons  within  [the remaining time till the first 25% of the  revision time is up],  it means that  there's no error or mistake  with the completed task the task doer has sent . Moving on,  as i told you earlier , if the task creator clicks the fix button, firstly the fix button and the continue button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, and then  a message (This message has an amharic version)  with the button attached below it  labeled as  “Accidental Request”  (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator, and i also told you what the message states but i forgot to tell you that after the task creator clicks the fix button , the bot will also send a separate message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator   every 20% of the remaining time till the first 25% of the revision time is up letting them know that they got [remaining time til the first 25% of the revision time is up] to send the message that notifies the task doer what mistakes or errors to fix; But also  the bot will only keep on sending this messages till either the first 25% of the revision time is up or till the task creator sends something(anything) to the bot before the first 25% of the revision time is up. Moving on, if the task creator clicks the fix button and  then sends a message or anything else that notifies the task Doer the mistakes they should fix within the time i stated earlier, the message or whatever the task creator sent plus a separate message (This message has an amharic version)  with a button attached below it labeled as “Non-Agreed upon” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent  to the task doer, and if it is a message the task creator sent, then it will be sent to the task doer in quotations letting the task doer know the task creator sent this message and the separate message sent to the task doer will let them(the task doer) know that the task creator wants them(the task doers) to fix the mistakes described above that they(the task doer) might have made , the separate message will also let them know that they got [ the remaining time til the first 50% of the  revision time is up] to submit the corrected and finalized task, the separate message will also let them know that if the task creator is trying to make them(the task doers) fix a mistake or error that they (the task doer) didn’t make i.e anything not described in the task description, they can click the non-agreed upon button below , the separate message will also let them know that if they plan to click the non-agreed upon button , they must click it within [the first 15% of the remaining time till 50% of the revision time is up]. A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the notification  is successfully sent to the task doer. Then if the task doer doesn’t click the non-agreed upon button within the first 15% of the remaining time till the first  50% of the revision time is up or if the task doer sends the updated and completed task within the first 15% of the remaining time till the first 50% of the revision time is up , the non-agreed upon button will stop doing anything .Then  if the task doer sends to the bot the updated and the completed task before 50% of the revision time is up , the updated and the completed task  and a separate message (This message has an amharic version)  below it that has two button below it labeled as “Not Fixed” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Fixed” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator , the message lets the task creator know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has sent the updated and the completed task above, the message also lets them know that if everything is fixed in the updated and the completed task, they can click the Fixed button below, but if something is not fixed in the  the updated and the completed task , they can click the Not Fixed button below, the message will also let them know that they must click one of the two buttons below within 20 minutes or taskifii will take it as if  they(the task creator) clicked the fix button. And also a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator every 5 minutes for 20 minutes or until the task creator clicks either button  letting them know how much time they got to click any of the two buttons till their 20 minutes are up .  Then if the task creator clicks the Fixed button within 20 minutes or if the task creator doesn’t click any of the two buttons within 20 minutes , same thing will happen as if the continue button was clicked(read the whole instructions to understand) i.e the fixed button and the continue button have the same function when clicked(the only difference they have is their button label, and also as you will see, when the continue button is clicked, the continue button and the fix button will then stop doing anything if they get clicked, but in this case , the fixed button and the not fixed button are the ones that will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, but all the rest of the things are the same) . But if the task creator clicks the not fixed button , the fixed button and the not fixed button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked , then a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator letting them know that this case will be studied by taskifii, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii reaches out to them. A message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that the task creator has claimed that something was not fixed in the updated and the completed task ,  the  message will also let them know that this case will be studied by taskifii, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii reaches out to them.  Then both the task doer and the task creator will be banned from using the bot and the group.  Then the Task post without the apply button, the related file(if the task creator gave a related file) , the completed task the task doer sent first, the updated and completed task the task doer sent , the notification message (or something else) the task creator sent that let the task doer know what errors or mistakes to fix,  the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the  task creator’s phone number with emphasis, and the receipt the task creator sent will all be sent to another private channel that has a chat id of “-1002432632907” as one giant message that has  Five buttons attached below it labeled as “Contact Task Doer” , “Contact Task Creator”, “ keep blocking task doer”, “keep blocking task creator”, and “Completed” . And the giant message will have two hashtags in it saying “#Mistake” and “#UnCompleted”  .And if the contact task doer  button is clicked ,  it will take the user that clicked it, to the bot ,  and then  a message  will be sent to the user  through the bot  letting them know  that they should write a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then  if the user gives a message  or anything else,  it will be sent to the task doer.  But if the user clicks the contact task Creator button,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then a message will be sent to the user through the bot letting them know that they should write a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or anything else,  it would be sent to the task creator . 
 But  if the keep blocking task doer  button was clicked  by a user,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user  letting them know  that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task doer.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task doer later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task doer (i will explain how next) . Then  the bot  will send to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month” . And  then  if the user clicks  the day button , the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 days).  But if the user clicked the month button,  the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of months they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning  the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task doer is banned/kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task doer will then get 5 one-star reviews as if  5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task creator, the task creator  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator five-star reviews. Then in the giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task doer” (written in red color).  But if a user clicks the unblock task doer button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task doer . Then the bot will unban the task doer from the bot as well as the group.  But if a user clicked the keep blocking task creator button , it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task creator.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task creator later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task creator (i will explain how next). Then  the bot  will send  to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month”.  And then if the user clicks the day button , the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to keep on banning the task creator. Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 days). Then if the user gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier, then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task creator is kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task creator will then get 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task doer, the task doer  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-star reviews. Then in the then giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task creator” (written in Blue color). But if a user clicks the unblock task creator button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task creator . Then the bot will unban the task creator from the bot as well as the group. Okay but if the completed button is clicked , it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. I also want you to know that if the giant message will then have the text “The guilty is the task creator” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task creator button) and next time if the task creator clicks the not fixed button for another task for the for the second time  , the then giant message will  have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task creator”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task creator again” , then the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task doer [half the task fee they(the task creator) planned to pay the first victim task doer] birr and till they pay the second victimized task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) were supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr , the message will also include both of the task doer’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doers, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task doer) letting them know that taskifii has found the task creator guilty so the task creator [task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii  . And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task doer a message letting them know that a previous task creator they have worked with in the past by the name [task creator’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task creator) did to them (the task doer) in the past to another task doer , the message will also let them know that because the task creator repeated their mistake again , the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they pay half of the task fee they were supposed to pay them (the task doer) to them (the task doer) plus another corresponding task fee to the other task doer, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task creator sends the monetary punishment they (the task doer) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task creator to only click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task doer, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they send as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that they must now send the receipt of payment for the second victimized task doer. Then if the task creator gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will exactly wait till the first victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task doer the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version), and the message will let them know that a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name] has finally sent the punishment fee of [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the first victimized task doer] birr to them(the first victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will also wait exactly till the second victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then bot will send to the second victimized task doer the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “ I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task creator was supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr to them(the second victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will ban(or keep on banning) the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s telegram username, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to first victimized task doer], the task creator’s telegram username, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#FVTD” ,and “#mistake2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button (which i will explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (first victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews each as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task doer would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task doer clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (and obviously fyi ,this sent button will appear  if the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens with more details , for now just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message(This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because both the task doers have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. Then also the bot will give the task creator 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews and the bot will also give both the task doer 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creator gave the task doer five-stars.And btw ,I forgot to tell you that ,as soon as the first victimized task doer or the second victimized task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task doer would have clicked the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task doer  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then the second receipt , the second victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s telegram username,  the second victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis ,the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to second victimized task doer] birr,  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#SVTD” ,and “#mistake2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button  is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doers five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task creator again” text in it  and if the task creator clicks the not fixed button for another task for the third time or more in the future , then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttc”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task creator is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttc button , the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e trying to make the task doer fix a mistake outside of the task description) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) was going to pay by the task doer] birr , the message will also include the task doer’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that after taskifii studied the case , the task creator has been found guilty so the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer). And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task creator to click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task creator) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), the bot will exactly wait till the task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,then the bot will send to the task doer the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the task doer] birr to them (the task doer), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task doer’s name with emphasis ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the task creator’s name with emphasis, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task creator’s email address with emphasis, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#TD” ,and “#mistake3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions.  And as i told you before, the task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because  the task doer have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then also the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii.

And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 



Okay going back now, I also want you to know that if the giant message would have had the text “The guilty is the task doer” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task doer button) and next time if the task doer gets in the situation like this for the for the second time in the future (i.e in the future for the second time, if a task creator clicks the not fixed button for a task  the task doer worked on/ was working on)   , the then giant message  sent will have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task doer”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task doer again”,  then the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first or the former victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr and till they pay the second or the current victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task creator) letting them know that taskifii has found the task doer guilty so the task doer [task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee/ monetary punishment fee to them(the task creators), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii. And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task creator a message letting them know that a previous task doer they have worked with in the past by the name [task doer’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task doer) did to them (the task creator) in the past to another task creator(a.k.a the second victimized task creator) , the message will also let them know that because the task doer repeated their mistake again , the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half of the task fee they were supposed to get paid by  them (the task creator)initially  to them (the task creator) plus another corresponding monetary punishment fee to the other task creator, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task doer sends the monetary punishment fee they (the task creator) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that they must give the receipt of payment for the second victimized task creator . Then if the task doer gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will wait exactly till the first victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task creator the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr to them(the first victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then also when the second victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,  bot will send to the second victimized task creator the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator] birr to them(the second victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t, they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task creator’s name with emphasis ,the first victimized task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the first victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr,  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”.

Then the bot will ban the  task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task creator’s name with emphasis ,the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#TC” ,and “#mistake3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because  the task creator have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task creator  clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 

If the task creator doesn’t click  the fix button or the continue button within the first 25% of the revision time or if the task creator  doesn’t send something to the bot nor click the accidental request button within the first 25% of the revision time after clicking the fix button or if the task creator clicks the accidental request button within the first 25% of the revision time after clicking the fix button or if the task creator clicks the continue button within the first 25% of the revision time or if the task creator clicks the fixed button or if the task creator clicks doesn’t click the fixed button or not fixed button within their times i told you earlier, the accidental request button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked(this is ofcourse if the task creator clicked the fix button but then after that ,did not either click the accidental request button within the first 25% of the revision time or send something to the bot with the first 25% of the revision time) ,then all the online banking details of the task doer , the task doer’s name , and a message (This message has an amharic version) below them will be sent to the task creator , the message will let the task creator know that they will choose the task doer’s online banking detail/s of their convenience above to send the task fee to them(the task doer) within exactly 30 minutes, the message will also let them know that after they send the money , they must send the the receipt here(to the bot) with in 30 minutes and that it doesn’t matter what format the receipt is (it can be a screenshot , pdf, link, ...etc…) . Then after all of this are sent to the task creator,  if the task creator sends something to the bot within 30 minutes,  whatever the task Creator sent to the bot  will be  sent to the task doer  with a message (This message has an amharic version)  and two buttons  attached below the message  labeled as “Approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Deny” (This button label has an amharic version),  the message  will let the task doer know that  the task creator has  claimed  that they ( the task creator)have sent  the task fee to  them (the task doer) ,  the message will also let them know that the task creator has sent  this file(whatever the task creator sent as a receipt)  as a proof that they have paid the task fee to them( the task  doer) ,  the message will also let them know that they must check if they have received the task fee  from the task creator  in which if they did , they can click the approve button below  but if they didn't receive any kind of task fee from the task creator,  they can click the deny button below, the message will also let them know that they got 5 minutes to click one of the buttons below otherwise taskifii will automatically assume that they (the task doer) have recieved the task fee so they must be quick to give an answer in 5 minutes, the message will also let them know that [the total birr amount deducted from the task fee before the task doer sent the completed task ] birr has been deducted from the task fee of [task fee] so they will get paid  [total birr amount deducted from the task fee before the task doer sent the completed task subtracted from the task fee] birr!. A message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the reciept has been successfully sent to the task doer , the message will also let them know that they must wait at most 5 minutes till the task doer confirms that they(the task doer) recieved the task fee.  And if the task doer clicks the approve button within the 5 minutes or if the task doer doesn’t click any of the two buttons within 5 minutes, the bot will resume waiting till the task doer sends the rest of the completed task within the time given for the task (if the task doer would have sent the first 50% of the completed task within the time given for the task) or till the task fee reaches zero amount (if the task doer would have sent the first 50% of the task after the time given for the task is up), and if you are confused by saying when did the bot paused waiting and the answer is that the bot will pause waiting as soon as the task doer sends the first 50% of the completed time within the probable times i described earlier. And before i tell you what happens if the task doer sends the rest of the task within the time given for the task (if the task doer would have sent the first 50% of the completed task within the time given for the task) or till the task fee reaches zero amount (if the task doer would have sent the first 50% of the task after the time given for the task is up), i want to tell a couple of other instructions so keep on reading.
 But if the task doer clicks the deny button before the 5 minutes are up, a message (This message has an amharic version)  with two buttons attached below it labeled as “Give a Week” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Report to Taskifii” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task doer letting them know that sometimes it might be network reasons or transaction delay reasons  so if they want to give it a week till the money potentially arrives to their bank account ,  they can click the give a week button , the message will also let them know that if they click the give a week button , they and the task creator [the task creator’s name] won’t be able to use taskifii till they either recieve the taskfee (and notify taskifii that they recieved it) within a week or till the week is up in which taskifii will get to the bottom of this and punish the one who is found guilty , the message will also let them know that if they want the taskifii team to get to the bottom of this as soon as possible, they can click the report to taskifii button, the message will aslo let them know that the taskifii team is a bit busy with other reports like theirs so they shall wait till taskifii studies their case , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this and reaches out to them, the message will also warn them to click one of the buttons below within 5 minutes otherwise taskifii will assume that they recieved the task fee. And a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has denied that they have recieved the task fee so now they (the task creator) must wait to see if the task doer either wishes to wait a week to recieve the task fee or report this case to taskifii. Then if the task doer clicks the give a week button  ,  the give a week button and the report to taskifii button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked , then a message (This message has an amharic version) with two buttons attached below it labeled as “Received” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Report to Taskifii” (This button label has an amharic version) (yes, this button will do the same thing as the one before in which i will tell you later what it does if it gets clicked)   will be sent to the task doer letting them know that they must click the received button if they have received the task fee before the week is up, the message will also let them know that once the week is up and they haven’t clicked the received button , taskifii will study this case and give the right measurement to whomever is found guilty, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they recieve the task fee and click the recieved button within a week or till taskifii studies this case(if they clicked the report to taskifii button ). But i before i continue i want you to know that from earlier if it was a situation where the task doer doesn’t click the give a week button or the report to taskifii button next to it in time (the time i told you earlier) or even now if the task doer clicks the recieved button within a week (i know it’s confusing what i said but since both of these have the same result i decided to tell you what happens if either of the things happen), the buttons(if the task doer didn’t click the give a week button or the report to taskifii button within a week ,  the give a week button and the report to taskifii button is what i mean by buttons here  but if the task doer where in the stage where they clicked the recieved button within a week , the recieved button and the report to taskifii button next to it is what i mean by buttons here) will now stop doing anything if they get clicked , then bot will send a message to the task doer and the task creator letting them know that sadly due to the payment delay and time delay , the contract for the task delegation can’t continue no further , then the bot will also send another message (This message has an amharic version) with 5 buttons (This button label has an amharic version) attached below it (each labeled with star emoji that in which the color inside the star is not yellow but the color of the button meaning this “ ☆”, and the buttons must be arranged in one horizontal line in which every buttons are next to each other) to the task doer and the task creator, the message (This message has an amharic version)  sent to the task doer will congratulate them in their success of finishing and delivering the first 50% of the completed task, the message will also thank them for doing their part and using taskifii, the message will also let them know that taskifii is happy to include  [the task doer’s name] as a trustworthy , responsible and valuable member of Taskifii , the message will also let them know taskifii is sorry any kind of inconvenience, the message will also let them know that they have reached the final stage in which they have to rate the task creator [task creator’s name] from one star to five stars , the message will also let them know that it’s mandatory for them to rate the task creator before gaining access to use taskifii again, the message will also let them  that if they click the first star , it means  their experience with the task Creator was Very poor or unsatisfactory,  but if they click the second star button it means their experience with the task Creator was Poor or below expectations,  but if they click the Third star button it means their experience with the task Creator was Average or met expectations,  but if they click the fourth star button it means their experience with the task Creator was good or exceeded their expectations,  but if they click the 5th start button it means their experience with the task creator was excellent or outstanding, and the message (This message has an amharic version)  sent to the task creator will congratulate them in their success of delegating atleats 50% of the task, the message will also thank them for doing their part, the message will also let them know that taskifii is  happy to include them [the task creator’s name ] as a trustworthy and valuable member of taskifii,  the message will also let them know that they have reached the final stage in which they have to rate the task doer [task doer’s name] from one star to five stars , the message will also let them know that it’s mandatory for them to rate the task doer before gaining access to use taskifii again, the message will also let them that if they click the first star button , it means their experience with the task doer was Very poor or unsatisfactory,  but  if they click the second star button it means their experience with the task doer was Poor or below expectations,  but if they click the Third star button it means their experience with the task doer was Average or met expectations,  but if they click the fourth star button it means their experience with the task doer was good or exceeded their expectations,  but if they click the 5th star button it means their experience with the task doer was excellent or outstanding. Then If the task doer clicks one of the 5 buttons , the color of the inside part of the star in the button clicked will turn to yellow as well as the ones before it (this is ofcourse if there any before it i.e if the user clicks the first star button in the left of the user’s point of view , the only star in a button in which the color  inside of the star will change to yellow will only be the first one that was clicked on because there is nothing before it) , then the buttons will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then a message (This message has an amharic version) will  be sent to the task doer letting them know that they have successfully rated the task creator , the message will also let them know that taskifii hopes they(the task doer) have enjoyed using the taskifii. But if the task creator clicks one of the 5 buttons , the color of the inside part of the star in the button clicked will turn to yellow as well as the ones before it (this is ofcourse if there any i.e if the user clicks the first star button in the left of the user’s point of view , the only star in a button in which the color  inside of the star will change to yellow will only be the first one that was clicked on because there is nothing before it), then the buttons will stop doing anything if they get clicked,  a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that they have successfully rated the task doer , the message will also let them know that taskifii hopes they(the task creator) have enjoyed using the taskifii. But if the task doer would have clicked the report to taskifii button (either one i.e if the task doer clicked the report to taskifii button within 5 minutes rather than clicking the give a week button next to it within 5 minutes or if the task doer would have clicked the report to taskifii button within a week rather than clicking the recieved button next to it within a week ) or if the task doer would have not clicked the recieved button or the report to taskifii button next to it within a week , the buttons (if the task doer would have clicked the report to taskifii button next to the give a week button within the 5 minutes , the give a week button and the report to taskifii button is what i mean by buttons here  but if the task doer where in the stage where they clicked the report to taskifii button next to the received button within a week , the recieved button and the report to taskifii button next to it is what i mean by buttons here)will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then  a message (This message has an amharic version)  will be sent  to the task doer letting them know that  taskifii has been notified about the report so they must wait till  taskifii studies this case and gets back to them(the task doers)  in which they(the task doer) can’t use taskifii till then . A message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has reported to taskifii that the task creator( in the message it will say “you”) did not send the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they shall wait till taskifii studies this case and gets back to them  in which they(the task creator) can’t use taskifii till then. Then the bot will ban the task doer and the task creator from using the bot as well as the group(the group i told you about earlier). Then the Task post without the apply button, the related file(if the task creator gave a related file) , the completed task the task doer sent, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the  task creator’s phone number with emphasis, and the receipt the task creator sent will all be sent to another private channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has  Five buttons attached below it labeled as “Contact Task Doer” , “Contact Task Creator”, “keep blocking task doer”, “keep blocking task creator”, and “Completed” . And the giant message will have two hashtags in it saying “#UnPaid” and “#UnCompleted” .  And if the contact task doer  button is clicked ,  it will take the user that clicked it, to the bot ,  and then  a message  will be sent to the user  through the bot  letting them know  that they should write a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then  if the user gives a message  or anything else,  it will be sent to the task doer.  But if the user clicks the contact task Creator button,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then a message will be sent to the user through the bot letting them know that they should write a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or anything else,  it would be sent to the task creator . 
 But  if the keep blocking task doer  button was clicked  by a user,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user  letting them know  that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task doer.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task doer later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task doer (i will explain how next) . Then  the bot  will send to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month” . And  then  if the user clicks  the day button , the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 days).  But if the user clicked the month button,  the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of months they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning  the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task doer is banned/kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task doer will then get 5 one-star reviews as if  5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task creator, the task creator  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator five-star reviews. Then in the giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task doer” (written in red color).  But if a user clicks the unblock task doer button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task doer . Then the bot will unban the task doer from the bot as well as the group.  But if a user clicked the keep blocking task creator button , it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task creator.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task creator later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task creator (i will explain how next). Then  the bot  will send  to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month”.  And then if the user clicks the day button , the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to keep on banning the task creator. Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 days). Then if the user gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier, then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task creator is kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task creator will then get 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task doer, the task doer  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-star reviews. Then in the then giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task creator” (written in Blue color). But if a user clicks the unblock task creator button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task creator . Then the bot will unban the task creator from the bot as well as the group. Okay but if the completed button is clicked , it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. I also want you to know that if the giant message will then have the text “The guilty is the task creator” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task creator button) and for the second time in the future, if the task creator gets the report to taskifii button clicked by a task doer on a task they posted , the then giant message will  have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task creator”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task creator again” , then the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task doer [half the task fee they(the task creator) planned to pay the first victim task doer] birr and till they pay the second victimized task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) were supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr , the message will also include both of the task doer’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doers, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task doer) letting them know that taskifii has found the task creator guilty so the task creator [task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii  . And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task doer a message letting them know that a previous task creator they have worked with in the past by the name [task creator’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task creator) did to them (the task doer) in the past to another task doer , the message will also let them know that because the task creator repeated their mistake again , the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they pay half of the task fee they were supposed to pay them (the task doer) to them (the task doer) plus another corresponding task fee to the other task doer, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task creator sends the monetary punishment they (the task doer) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task creator to only click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task doer, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they send as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that they must now send the receipt of payment for the second victimized task doer. Then if the task creator gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will exactly wait till the first victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task doer the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version), and the message will let them know that a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name] has finally sent the punishment fee of [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the first victimized task doer] birr to them(the first victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will also wait exactly till the second victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then bot will send to the second victimized task doer the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “ I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task creator was supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr to them(the second victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will ban(or keep on banning) the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s telegram username, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to first victimized task doer], the task creator’s telegram username, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#FVTD” ,and “#unpaid2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button (which i will explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (first victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews each as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task doer would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task doer clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (and obviously fyi ,this sent button will appear  if the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens with more details , for now just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message(This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because both the task doers have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. Then also the bot will give the task creator 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews and the bot will also give both the task doer 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creator gave the task doer five-stars.And btw ,I forgot to tell you that ,as soon as the first victimized task doer or the second victimized task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task doer would have clicked the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task doer  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then the second receipt , the second victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s telegram username,  the second victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis ,the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to second victimized task doer] birr,  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#SVTD” ,and “#unpaid2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button  is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doers five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task creator again” text in it  and  for the third time or more in the future, if the task creator gets the report to taskifii button clicked by a task doer on a task they posted , then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttc”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task creator is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttc button , the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e making the task doer fix a mistake outside of the task description) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) was going to pay by the task doer] birr , the message will also include the task doer’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that after taskifii studied the case , the task creator has been found guilty so the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer). And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task creator to click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task creator) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), the bot will exactly wait till the task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,then the bot will send to the task doer the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the task doer] birr to them (the task doer), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task doer’s name with emphasis ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the task creator’s name with emphasis, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task creator’s email address with emphasis, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#TD” ,and “#unpaid3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions.  And as i told you before, the task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because  the task doer have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii.

Okay going back now, I also want you to know that if the giant message would have had the text “The guilty is the task doer” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task doer button) and next time if the task doer gets in the situation like this for the for the second time in the future (i.e in the future for the second time, if the task doer clicks the report to taskifii button for another task)   , the then giant message  sent will have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task doer”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task doer again”,  then the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first or the former victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr and till they pay the second or the current victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task creator) letting them know that taskifii has found the task doer guilty so the task doer [task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee/ monetary punishment fee to them(the task creators), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii. And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task creator a message letting them know that a previous task doer they have worked with in the past by the name [task doer’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task doer) did to them (the task creator) in the past to another task creator(a.k.a the second victimized task creator) , the message will also let them know that because the task doer repeated their mistake again , the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half of the task fee they were supposed to get paid by  them (the task creator)initially  to them (the task creator) plus another corresponding monetary punishment fee to the other task creator, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task doer sends the monetary punishment fee they (the task creator) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt .

Then also when the second victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,  bot will send to the second victimized task creator the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator] birr to them(the second victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t, they must click the i deny button.

And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task doer again” text in it  and if the task doer gets in the situation like this  for the third time or more in the future (i.e in the future for the third time or more, if they click the report to taskifii button for another task), then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttd”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task doer is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttd button , the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has found them guilty by a situation(i.e for lying by saying i didn’t recieve the task fee) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the task creator] birr , the message will also include  task creator’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that after taskifii studied the case ,the task doer has been found guilty so the task doer  has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creator). And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task doer) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), when the task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , the bot will send to the task creator the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator] birr to them (the task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task creator’s name with emphasis ,the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#TC” ,and “#unpaid3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because  the task creator have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task creator  clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed.
 And if the task doer would have clicked the non-agreed upon button before the time to click the non-agreed upon button was up, a message with a button attached below it labeled as “Cancel this report” will be sent to the task doer letting them know that they should send a message that explains at least one thing that is a non agreed upon work outside of the task description that the task creator insisted them(the task doer) to fix in the completed task/50% of it , the message will also let them know that they got 5 minutes to send the message or they won’t get another chance to report this. Then if the task doer doesn’t send a message within 5 minutes or if the task doer clicks the cancel this report button within 5 minutes   , the cancel this report button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked , then the bot will wait till the task doer sends the updated and completed task before the revision time is up, in which if they do or not , the exact same thing or process will happen as i told earlier (i.e the process  i told you of what happens if the task doer sends the updated and completed task before the revision time is up rather than clicking the non agreed upon button ).  But if the task doer would have sent a message or something to the bot within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button ,  the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has claimed that the task creator (in the message it will say “you”) is insisting them(the task doer) to fix something that is a non agreed upon extra work outside of the task description,  the message will also let them know that taskifii will get to the bottom of this and punish the one who is found guilty, the message will also let the task creator know that the taskifii team has a lot complaints like this to resolve so it might take a while till taskifii studies this case , the message will also let them know that they (the task creator) can’t unfortunately use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this.  And also from the task doer side a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent letting them know that they have successfully sent the report claim to taskifii, the message will also let them know that they shall wait till taskifii team studies this case and gets to the bottom of it , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this. Then both the task doer and the task creator will be banned from using both the group and this bot until i can study this case and confirm the one who is guilty and the way this happens is once the task doer gives a message or anything within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button , the message or something the task creator sent within first 50% of the revision time after clicking the fix button , the message the task doer sent within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button , the related file (if there is any), the task post without the apply button, the task doer’s name with emphasis ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, and the  task creator’s phone number with emphasis will all be sent to another channel (which has the chat id :--1002432632907) as one giant message(which will have two hashtags in it saying “#nonagreedupon” and “#UnCompleted”) with seven buttons  attached below it labeled as “Contact Task Doer” , “Contact Task Creator”, “ keep blocking task doer”, “keep blocking task creator”, “Unblock task doer”, “Unblock Task creator” and “Completed” .  And if the contact task doer  button is clicked ,  it will take the user that clicked it, to the bot ,  and then  a message  will be sent to the user  through the bot  letting them know  that they should write a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then  if the user gives a message  or anything else,  it will be sent to the task doer.  But if the user clicks the contact task Creator button,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then a message will be sent to the user through the bot letting them know that they should write a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or anything else,  it would be sent to the task creator . 
 But  if the keep blocking task doer  button was clicked  by a user,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user  letting them know  that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task doer.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task doer later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task doer (i will explain how next) . Then  the bot  will send to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month” . And  then  if the user clicks  the day button , the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 days).  But if the user clicked the month button,  the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of months they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning  the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task doer is banned/kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task doer will then get 5 one-star reviews as if  5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task creator, the task creator  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator five-star reviews. Then in the giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task doer” (written in red color).  But if a user clicks the unblock task doer button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task doer . Then the bot will unban the task doer from the bot as well as the group.  But if a user clicked the keep blocking task creator button , it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task creator.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task creator later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task creator (i will explain how next). Then  the bot  will send  to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month”.  And then if the user clicks the day button , the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to keep on banning the task creator. Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 days). Then if the user gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier, then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task creator is kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task creator will then get 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task doer, the task doer  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-star reviews. Then in the then giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task creator” (written in Blue color). But if a user clicks the unblock task creator button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task creator . Then the bot will unban the task creator from the bot as well as the group. Okay but if the completed button is clicked , it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. I also want you to know that if the giant message will then have the text “The guilty is the task creator” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task creator button) and for the second time ,if the task creator gets a non agreed upon report from a task doer in the future (i.e if task doer sends a message within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button) , the giant message will then have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task creator”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task creator again” , then the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task doer [half the task fee they(the task creator) planned to pay the first victim task doer] birr and till they pay the second victimized task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) were supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr , the message will also include both of the task doer’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doers, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task doer will be un banned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task doer) letting them know that taskifii has found the task creator guilty so the task creator [task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii  . And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task doer a message letting them know that a previous task creator they have worked with in the past by the name [task creator’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task creator) did to them (the task doer) in the past to another task doer , the message will also let them know that because the task creator repeated their mistake again , the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they pay half of the task fee they were supposed to pay them (the task doer) to them (the task doer) plus another corresponding task fee to the other task doer, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task creator sends the monetary punishment they (the task doer) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task creator to only click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task doer, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they send as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that they must now send the receipt of payment for the second victimized task doer. Then if the task creator gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will exactly wait till the first victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task doer the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version), and the message will let them know that a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name] has finally sent the punishment fee of [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the first victimized task doer] birr to them(the first victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will also wait exactly till the second victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then bot will send to the second victimized task doer the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “ I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task creator was supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr to them(the second victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will ban(or keep on banning) the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s telegram username, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to first victimized task doer], the task creator’s telegram username, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#FVTD” ,and “#nonagreedupon2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button (which i will explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (first victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews each as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task doer would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task doer clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (and obviously fyi ,this sent button will appear  if the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens with more details , for now just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message(This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because both the task doers have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. Then also the bot will give the task creator 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews and the bot will also give both the task doer 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creator gave the task doer five-stars.And btw ,I forgot to tell you that ,as soon as the first victimized task doer or the second victimized task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task doer would have clicked the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task doer  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then the second receipt , the second victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s telegram username,  the second victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis ,the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to second victimized task doer] birr,  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#SVTD” ,and “#nonagreedupon2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button  is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doers five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task creator again” text in it  and for the third time or more ,if the task creator gets a non agreed upon report from a task doer in the future (i.e for the third time or more in the future , if a task doer sends a message within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button for a task), then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttc”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task creator is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttc button , the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e trying to make the task doer fix a mistake that wasn’t theirs) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) was going to pay by the task doer] birr , the message will also include the task doer’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that after taskifii studied the case , the task creator has been found guilty so the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer). And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task creator to click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task creator) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), the bot will exactly wait till the task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,then the bot will send to the task doer the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the task doer] birr to them (the task doer), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task doer’s name with emphasis ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the task creator’s name with emphasis, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task creator’s email address with emphasis, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#TD” ,and “#nonagreedupon3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because  the task doer have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then also the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 



Okay going back now, I also want you to know that if the giant message would have had the text “The guilty is the task doer” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task doer button) and for the second time  ,if the task doer gives a non agreed upon report in in the future (i.e for the second time in the future , if the task doer sends a message within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button) , the then giant message  sent will have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task doer”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task doer again”,  then the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first or the former victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr and till they pay the second or the current victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task creator) letting them know that taskifii has found the task doer guilty so the task doer [task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee/ monetary punishment fee to them(the task creators), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii. And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task creator a message letting them know that a previous task doer they have worked with in the past by the name [task doer’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task doer) did to them (the task creator) in the past to another task creator(a.k.a the second victimized task creator) , the message will also let them know that because the task doer repeated their mistake again , the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half of the task fee they were supposed to get paid by  them (the task creator)initially  to them (the task creator) plus another corresponding monetary punishment fee to the other task creator, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task doer sends the monetary punishment fee they (the task creator) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that they must give the receipt of payment for the second victimized task creator . Then if the task doer gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will wait exactly till the first victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task creator the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr to them(the first victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then also when the second victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,  bot will send to the second victimized task creator the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator] birr to them(the second victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t, they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task creator’s name with emphasis ,the first victimized task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the first victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr,  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#FVTC” ,and “#nonagreedupon2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the first victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist),  the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( first victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews.

But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (this is ofcourse if the second victimized task creator clicked the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens, just know there is a sent button involved in it ) (btw the same goes vice versa i.e if a user clicked the sent button or if the second victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the first victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that because both the task creators have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii.

And btw , as soon as the first victimized task creator or the second victimized task creator clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button,both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task creator  will be unbanned from the bot and the group, then  the second receipt , the second victimized task creator’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis ,the second victimized task creator’s telegram username ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee of the task the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator],  task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”.

Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews.

But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because  the task creator have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task creator  clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed.  And if the task doer clicks the non agreed upon button and doesn’t send a message within 5 minutes after clicking it  or if the task doer clicks the cancel this report button within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button , as i told you before the non agreed upon button will then after stop doing anything if it gets clicked ,then the bot will still wait till the task doer sends the updated and completed task within revision time in which if they do , the same thing will happen as before. 

 

 Okay now moving on, i forgot to tell you that If the task Doer would have sent the first 50% of the completed task within the time given to finish and submit the completed task a.k.a time given for the task,  firstly the  violation button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked(if the completed task was sent before the time to click the violation button was up),  then the same thing would happen as if the task doer would have sent the completed task / 50% of it after the time given for the task was up but before the task fee reached zero (in which i explain somewhere in this instructions before).  
 And btw i forgot to tell you that if the task doer wouldn’t have sent the completed task at all,  even within the time given for the task or even after that (i.e till task fee reaches zero) or if the task doer wouldn’t have sent  the updated and completed  task within 50% of the the revision time , a message will be sent to the task doer letting them know that they have been banned from taskifii for 5 months for not meeting their obligations, the message will also let them know that if they repeat this action again , there will be some monetary punishment to pay. Then the bot will ban the task doer from the bot and the group for 5 months. Then after the 5 months are up (i.e after the task doer is no longer banned from the bot and the group), the Bot will send a message to the task doer letting them know that they can now start using taskifii ,  the message will also let them know that they should be careful in not repeating this action again otherwise next time there would be monetary punishments to pay. If the task doer repeats this mistake for the second time again i.e not send the completed task at all (i.e if they don’t send the completed task neither within the time given for the task nor after that ,till task fee reaches zero),  the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victim task creator] birr and till they pay the second victim task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victim task creator and the second task creator letting them know that the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creators). And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that they must give the receipt of payment for the second victimized task creator . Then if the task doer gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) and when the first victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , the bot will send to the first victimized task creator the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr to them(the first victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then also when the second victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,  bot will send to the second victimized task creator the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator] birr to them(the second victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t, they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task creator’s name with emphasis ,the first victimized task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the first victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator],  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#FVTC” ,and “#undelivered2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the first victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( first victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (this is ofcourse if the second victimized task creator clicked the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens, just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because both the task creators have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the first victimized task creator or the second victimized task creator clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task creator  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then  the second receipt , the second victimized task creator’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis ,the second victimized task creator’s telegram username ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee of the task the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator],  task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#SVTC” ,and “#undelivered2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars each . Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 
If the task doer repeats this mistake ( i.e not send the completed task at all (i.e if they don’t send the completed task neither within the time given for the task nor after that ,till task fee reaches zero) ) for the third time or more, the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has completed studying the case and taskifii has found them guilty by a situation like this for the third time or more (i.e not sending the completed task at all ( neither within the time given for the task nor after that ,till task fee reaches zero) for the third time or more ) so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the task creator] birr , the message will also include  task creator’s name(with emphasis) and all their (the task creator’s) banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creator). And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task doer) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), when the task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , the bot will send to the task creator the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator] birr to them (the task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task creator’s name with emphasis ,the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#TC” ,and “#undelivered3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because  the task creator have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task creator  clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 

Now i'm going to tell what happens if the task doer clicks the approve button in which the task doer would have sent the first 50% of the completed task within the time given for the task  , the bot will resume waiting for task doer to send the final 50% of the task within the time given for the task or till task fee reaches zero (if the task doer failed to send the final 50% of the task within the time given for the task (keep on reading , you will understand what i mean))(and if you forgot in case when the bot paused waiting , the bot paused waiting when the task doer sent the first 50% of the completed task in time) ,then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer every 20% of the remaining time till the time given for the task has gone by, and the message will let the task doer know that they got [the remaining till the time given for the task is up] to submit the rest of the completed task to the bot so that they must send the final 50% of the task quickly. But the bot will only keep on sending this message to the task doer till either  the task doer sends the rest of the completed task to the bot within the time given for the task or till the time given for the task is up .   Okay moving on, before i tell you what happens if the task doer clicks the approve button in which the task doer would have sent the first 50% of the completed task within the time given for the task, i want to first tell you what happens If the task doer doesn’t send the completed task/the final 50% of the completed task within the time given for the task , which is that an alertful message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task doer every 20% of the remaining time til the task fee reaches zero amount (sorry for confusing you, the reason why task fee will reach zero amount is because the birr amount deducted per hour from the task fee(the task creator would have given this earlier in task inquiry format) will start being deducted from the task fee every hour once the task doer missed the chance to send the final 50% of the completed within the time given to do the task) and the messages will be kept on being sent to the task doer til either the task doer sends the completed task or the final 50% of it within the remaining time till task fee reaches zero amount or till the task fee reaches zero, the message will warn them that they were late to submit the rest of the completed task/the final 50% of it  so starting from the current time  [birr amount deducted  per hour from task fee] birr  (the task creator gave this  earlier in the task inquiry format) will be deducted from their task fee till either the task fee reaches zero birr amount or til they send the final 50% of the completed task, the message will also let them know that if the task fee reaches zero amount before they submit the final 50% of the completed task to the bot, they will be banned from using taskifii for 5 months and if they repeat this mistake again, there would be a monetary punishment to use taskifii again i.e they will pay half the task fee to the former victim task creator and the new victim task creator, the message  will also let them know that they got [the remaining time til the task fee reaches zero] to submit the task . 
And also an alertful message (This message has an amharic version)  will be sent to the task creator every 20% of the remaining time til the task fee reaches zero amount (the reason why it will reach zero amount is because the birr amount deducted per hour from the task fee (the task creator would have given this earlier) will start being deducted from the task fee every hour once the task doer missed the chance to send the completed task  with in the time given to do the task and til either the task doer sends the completed task within the remaining time till task fee reaches zero amount or till the task fee reaches zero amount) , and the message let’s them know that the task doer hasn’t  delivered the final 50%of the completed task within the time given for the task , the message will also let them know that  [ the birr amount deducted per hour from task fee] birr will be deducted from the task fee every hour till either the task fee reaches zero amount or til the task doer sends the final 50% of the completed task before the task fee reaches zero amount. 
Okay then if the task doer sends the rest of the completed task before the task fee reaches zero amount ,  then the rest of the completed task the task doer sent  would be sent to the task creator with a message (This message has an amharic version) attached  below it  and the message will have two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Fix” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Continue” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that the task doer has sent this 50% of the completed task to them,  the message will also let them know that they must check for any errors or mistakes  made by the task doer,  the message will also let them  that if they find  an   error or mistake  made by the task Doer ,they(the task creator) can notify and make the task Doer  fix whatever the error or mistake they(the task doer) made,  the message will also let them know that they got [ 25% of the Revision Time] (the task doer gave earlier in the task inquiry) to click the fix button and give a message that will be sent to the  task doer to fix any mistakes they might have made ,  the message will also let them know that  the  task doer  will fix the mistakes  and send the updated and  completed task within [the remaining time till 50% of the revision time is up ], the  message will also let them know that if they click  the  continue button  it means that there is no error or mistake in the completed task the task doer sent ,  the message will also let them know that if they click the continue button,  it means  that they they want to move on ,  the message will also let them know  that if they don't click the fix button within [the 25% of the revision time] , it's going to be taken as the rest of the completed task sent has no error or mistakes in it.  And also while this message is being sent to task creator, another message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task doer  letting them know that they have successfully sent the rest 50% of the completed task,  the message will also let them know that the task Creator is reviewing and checking for any kind of errors or mistakes they(the task doer) might have made,  the message will also let them know that the task creator has [the  25% of the revision time] to notify them(the task doers) about any kind of errors or mistakes they(the task doers) might have made so that they (task doers)can quickly fix them and send the updated ,correct and  completed task here (to the bot), the message will also let the task doer know that they must  wait attentively for at most [the 25% of the revision time] til/ if the task creator notifies about a potential mistake or error they (the task doer) must fix so that they(the task doer) can use their remaining time effectively til the time given to send the updated and completed task is up  . Then after both this messages is sent to the receivers  , and then  if the task creator clicks the fix button  before the  25% of the revision time has passed, a message (This message has an amharic version)  with a button attached below it labeled as “Accidental Request” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator letting them know that they should write  one message letting the task doer know every mistakes & errors they(the task doer) must fix, the message will also let them know that they must make everything clear for the task doer to understand , the message will also let them know that they got [the remaining time til the  25% of the revision time is up] to send the message here(to the bot), The message will also let them know that if they click The Accidental request button it means that the  50% of the completed task sent by the task Doer  has no errors or mistakes in it so they( the task creator)  should be aware of that if they click The Accidental request button once ,there is no going back. Before i continue , i forgot to tell you that a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator every 20 % of the  25% of the revision time  till they either click the fix button or the continue button , and the message let’s them know how much time they got to click the fix button and notify the task doer any errors or mistakes to fix if there is any,  the message will also let them know that if they click the continue button before [the remaining time til the  25% of the revision time is up] or if they don’t click any of the two buttons  within  [the remaining time till the 25% of the  revision time is up],  it means that  there's no error or mistake  with the rest of the completed task the task doer has sent . Moving on,  as i told you earlier , if the task creator clicks the fix button, firstly the fix button and the continue button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, and then  a message (This message has an amharic version)  with the button attached below it  labeled as  “Accidental Request”  (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator, and i also told you what the message states but i forgot to tell you that after the task creator clicks the fix button , the bot will also send a separate message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator   every 20% of the remaining time till the 25% of the revision time is up letting them know that they got [remaining time til the  25% of the revision time is up] to send the message that notifies the task doer what mistakes or errors to fix; But also  the bot will only keep on sending this messages till either the  25% of the revision time is up or till the task creator sends something(anything) to the bot before the  25% of the revision time is up. Moving on, if the task creator clicks the fix button and  then sends a message or anything else that notifies the task Doer the mistakes they should fix within the time i stated earlier, the message or whatever the task creator sent plus a separate message (This message has an amharic version)  with a button attached below it labeled as “Non-Agreed upon” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent  to the task doer, and if it is a message the task creator sent, then it will be sent to the task doer in quotations letting the task doer know the task creator sent this message and the separate message sent to the task doer will let them(the task doer) know that the task creator wants them(the task doers) to fix the mistakes described above that they(the task doer) might have made , the separate message will also let them know that they got [ the remaining time til the  50% of the  revision time is up] to submit the corrected and finalized task, the separate message will also let them know that if the task creator is trying to make them(the task doers) fix a mistake or error that they (the task doer) didn’t make i.e anything not described in the task description, they can click the non-agreed upon button below , the separate message will also let them know that if they plan to click the non-agreed upon button , they must click it within [the first 15% of the remaining time till 50% of the revision time is up]. A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the notification  is successfully sent to the task doer. Then if the task doer doesn’t click the non-agreed upon button within the first 15% of the remaining time till the  50% of the revision time is up or if the task doer sends the updated and completed task within the first 15% of the remaining time till the 50% of the revision time is up , the non-agreed upon button will stop doing anything .Then  if the task doer sends to the bot the updated and the completed task before 50% of the revision time is up , the updated and the completed task  and a separate message (This message has an amharic version)  below it that has two button below it labeled as “Not Fixed” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Fixed” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator , the message lets the task creator know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has sent the updated and the completed task above, the message also lets them know that if everything is fixed in the updated and the completed task, they can click the Fixed button below, but if something is not fixed in the  the updated and the completed task , they can click the Not Fixed button below, the message will also let them know that they must click one of the two buttons below within 20 minutes or taskifii will take it as if  they(the task creator) clicked the fixed button. And also a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator every 5 minutes for 20 minutes( until the task creator clicks either button within 20 minutes or till the 20 minutes are up)  letting them know how much time they got to click any of the two buttons till their 20 minutes are up .  Then if the task creator clicks the Fixed button within 20 minutes or if the task creator doesn’t click any of the two buttons within 20 minutes , same thing will happen as if the continue button was clicked(read the whole instructions to understand) i.e the fixed button and the continue button have the same function when clicked(the only difference they have is their button label, and also as you will see, when the continue button is clicked, the continue button and the fix button will then stop doing anything if they get clicked, but in this case , the fixed button and the not fixed button are the ones that will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, but all the rest of the things are the same) . But if the task creator clicks the not fixed button , the fixed button and the not fixed button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked , then a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator letting them know that this case will be studied by taskifii, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii reaches out to them. A message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that the task creator has claimed that something was not fixed in the updated and the completed task ,  the  message will also let them know that this case will be studied by taskifii, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii reaches out to them.  Then both the task doer and the task creator will be banned from using the bot and the group.  Then the Task post without the apply button, the related file(if the task creator gave a related file) , the completed task the task doer sent first, the updated and completed task the task doer sent , the notification message (or something else) the task creator sent that let the task doer know what errors or mistakes to fix,  the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the  task creator’s phone number with emphasis, and the receipt the task creator sent will all be sent to another private channel that has a chat id of “-1002432632907” as one giant message that has  Five buttons attached below it labeled as “Contact Task Doer” , “Contact Task Creator”, “ keep blocking task doer”, “keep blocking task creator”, and “Completed” . And the giant message will have two hashtags in it saying “#Mistake” and “#UnCompleted”  .And if the contact task doer  button is clicked ,  it will take the user that clicked it, to the bot ,  and then  a message  will be sent to the user  through the bot  letting them know  that they should write a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then  if the user gives a message  or anything else,  it will be sent to the task doer.  But if the user clicks the contact task Creator button,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then a message will be sent to the user through the bot letting them know that they should write a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or anything else,  it would be sent to the task creator . 
 But  if the keep blocking task doer  button was clicked  by a user,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user  letting them know  that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task doer.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task doer later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task doer (i will explain how next) . Then  the bot  will send to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month” . And  then  if the user clicks  the day button , the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 days).  But if the user clicked the month button,  the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of months they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning  the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task doer is banned/kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task doer will then get 5 one-star reviews as if  5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task creator, the task creator  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator five-star reviews. Then in the giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task doer” (written in red color).  But if a user clicks the unblock task doer button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task doer . Then the bot will unban the task doer from the bot as well as the group.  But if a user clicked the keep blocking task creator button , it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task creator.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task creator later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task creator (i will explain how next). Then  the bot  will send  to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month”.  And then if the user clicks the day button , the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to keep on banning the task creator. Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 days). Then if the user gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier, then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task creator is kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task creator will then get 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task doer, the task doer  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-star reviews. Then in the then giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task creator” (written in Blue color). But if a user clicks the unblock task creator button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task creator . Then the bot will unban the task creator from the bot as well as the group. Okay but if the completed button is clicked , it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. I also want you to know that if the giant message will then have the text “The guilty is the task creator” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task creator button) and next time if the task creator clicks the not fixed button for another task for the for the second time  , the then giant message will  have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task creator”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task creator again” , then the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task doer [half the task fee they(the task creator) planned to pay the first victim task doer] birr and till they pay the second victimized task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) were supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr , the message will also include both of the task doer’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doers, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task doer) letting them know that taskifii has found the task creator guilty so the task creator [task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii  . And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task doer a message letting them know that a previous task creator they have worked with in the past by the name [task creator’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task creator) did to them (the task doer) in the past to another task doer , the message will also let them know that because the task creator repeated their mistake again , the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they pay half of the task fee they were supposed to pay them (the task doer) to them (the task doer) plus another corresponding task fee to the other task doer, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task creator sends the monetary punishment they (the task doer) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task creator to only click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task doer, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they send as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that they must now send the receipt of payment for the second victimized task doer. Then if the task creator gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will exactly wait till the first victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task doer the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version), and the message will let them know that a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name] has finally sent the punishment fee of [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the first victimized task doer] birr to them(the first victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will also wait exactly till the second victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then bot will send to the second victimized task doer the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “ I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task creator was supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr to them(the second victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will ban(or keep on banning) the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s telegram username, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to first victimized task doer], the task creator’s telegram username, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#FVTD” ,and “#mistake2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button (which i will explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (first victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews each as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task doer would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task doer clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (and obviously fyi ,this sent button will appear  if the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens with more details , for now just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message(This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because both the task doers have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. Then also the bot will give the task creator 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews and the bot will also give both the task doer 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creator gave the task doer five-stars.And btw ,I forgot to tell you that ,as soon as the first victimized task doer or the second victimized task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task doer would have clicked the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task doer  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then the second receipt , the second victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s telegram username,  the second victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis ,the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to second victimized task doer] birr,  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#SVTD” ,and “#mistake2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button  is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doers five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task creator again” text in it  and if the task creator clicks the not fixed button for another task for the third time or more in the future , then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttc”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task creator is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttc button , the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e trying to make the task doer fix a mistake outside of the task description) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) was going to pay by the task doer] birr , the message will also include the task doer’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that after taskifii studied the case , the task creator has been found guilty so the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer). And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task creator to click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task creator) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt .

If the  task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task doer’s name with emphasis ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the task creator’s name with emphasis, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task creator’s email address with emphasis, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#TD” ,and “#mistake3+”.

Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because  the task doer have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then also the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 



Okay going back now, I also want you to know that if the giant message would have had the text “The guilty is the task doer” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task doer button) and next time if the task doer gets in the situation like this for the for the second time in the future (i.e in the future for the second time, if a task creator clicks the not fixed button for a task  the task doer worked on/ was working on)   , the then giant message  sent will have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task doer”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task doer again”,  then the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first or the former victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr and till they pay the second or the current victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task creator) letting them know that taskifii has found the task doer guilty so the task doer [task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee/ monetary punishment fee to them(the task creators), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii. And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task creator a message letting them know that a previous task doer they have worked with in the past by the name [task doer’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task doer) did to them (the task creator) in the past to another task creator(a.k.a the second victimized task creator) , the message will also let them know that because the task doer repeated their mistake again , the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half of the task fee they were supposed to get paid by  them (the task creator)initially  to them (the task creator) plus another corresponding monetary punishment fee to the other task creator, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task doer sends the monetary punishment fee they (the task creator) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that they must give the receipt of payment for the second victimized task creator . Then if the task doer gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will wait exactly till the first victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task creator the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr to them(the first victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then also when the second victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,  bot will send to the second victimized task creator the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator] birr to them(the second victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t, they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task creator’s name with emphasis ,the first victimized task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the first victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr,  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#FVTC” ,and “#mistake2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the first victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist),  the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( first victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (this is ofcourse if the second victimized task creator clicked the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens, just know there is a sent button involved in it ) (btw the same goes vice versa i.e if a user clicked the sent button or if the second victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the first victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that because both the task creators have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the first victimized task creator or the second victimized task creator clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button,both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task creator  will be unbanned from the bot and the group, then  the second receipt , the second victimized task creator’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis ,the second victimized task creator’s telegram username ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee of the task the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator],  task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#SVTC” ,and “#mistake2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions.

Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars each .

Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task doer again” text in it  and if the task doer gets in the situation like this  for the third time or more in the future (i.e in the future for the third time or more, if a task creator clicks the not fixed button for a task the task doer worked on/was working on )  , then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttd”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task doer is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttd button , the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e not fixing the mistakes they made in the task in time) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the task creator] birr , the message will also include  task creator’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that after taskifii studied the case ,the task doer has been found guilty so the task doer  has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creator).

Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews.

Okay i forgot to tell you thatIf the task creator doesn’t click  the fix button or the continue button within the  25% of the revision time or if the task creator  doesn’t send something to the bot within the  25% of the revision time after clicking the fix button or if the task creator doesn’t click the accidental request button within the  25% of the revision time after clicking the fix button or if the task creator clicks the continue button within the 25% of the revision time or if the task creator clicks the fixed button within its time or if the task creator clicks the accidental request within it’s time,   the accidental request button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked(this is ofcourse if the task creator clicked the fix button but then after that ,did not either click the accidental request button within the 25% of the revision time or send something to the bot with the  25% of the revision time) , then all the online banking details of the task doer , the task doer’s name , and a message (This message has an amharic version) below them will be sent to the task creator , the message will let the task creator know that they will choose the task doer’s online banking detail/s of their convenience above to send the task fee to them(the task doer) within exactly 30 minutes, the message will also let them know that after they send the money , they must send the the receipt here(to the bot) with in 30 minutes and that it doesn’t matter what format the receipt is (it can be a screenshot , pdf, link, ...etc…) . Then after all of this are sent to the task creator,  if the task creator sends something to the bot within 30 minutes,  whatever the task Creator sent to the bot  will be  sent to the task doer  with a message (This message has an amharic version)  and two buttons  attached below the message  labeled as “Approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Deny” (This button label has an amharic version),  the message  will let the task doer know that  the task creator has  claimed  that they ( the task creator)have sent  the task fee to  them (the task doer) ,  the message will also let them know that the task creator has sent  this file(whatever the task creator sent as a receipt)  as a proof that they have paid the task fee to them( the task  doer) ,  the message will also let them know that they must check if they have received the task fee  from the task creator  in which if they did , they can click the approve button below  but if they didn't receive any kind of task fee from the task creator,  they can click the deny button below, the message will also let them know that they got 5 minutes to click one of the buttons below otherwise taskifii will automatically assume that they (the task doer) have recieved the task fee so they must be quick to give an answer in 5 minutes, the message will also let them know that [the total birr amount deducted from the task fee before the task doer sent the completed task ] birr has been deducted from the task fee of [task fee] so they will get paid  [total birr amount deducted from the task fee before the task doer sent the completed task subtracted from the task fee] birr!. A message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the reciept has been successfully sent to the task doer , the message will also let them know that they must wait at most 5 minutes till the task doer confirms that they(the task doer) recieved the task fee.  And if the task doer clicks the approve button within the 5 minutes or if the task doer doesn’t click any of the two buttons within 5 minutes, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) with 5 buttons (This button label has an amharic version) attached below it (each labeled with star emoji that in which the color inside the star is not yellow but the color of the button meaning this “ ☆”, and the buttons must be arranged in one horizontal line in which every buttons are next to each other) to the task doer and the task creator, the message sent to the task doer will congratulate them in their success of finishing and delivering the completed task, the message will also thank them for doing their part , the message will also let them know that taskifii is happy to include  [the task doer’s name] as a trustworthy , responsible and valuable member of Taskifii , the message will also let them know that they have reached the final stage in which they have to rate the task creator [task creator’s name] from one star to five stars , the message will also let them know that it’s mandatory for them to rate the task creator before gaining access to use taskifii again, the message will also let them  that if they click the first star , it means  their experience with the task Creator was Very poor or unsatisfactory,  but if they click the second star button it means their experience with the task Creator was Poor or below expectations,  but if they click the Third star button it means their experience with the task Creator was Average or met expectations,  but if they click the fourth star button it means their experience with the task Creator was good or exceeded their expectations,  but if they click the 5th start button it means their experience with the task creator was excellent or outstanding, and the message sent to the task creator will congratulate them in their success of delegating a task, the message will also thank them for doing their part, the message will also let them know that taskifii is  happy to include them [the task creator’s name ] as a trustworthy and valuable member of taskifii,  the message will also let them know that they have reached the final stage in which they have to rate the task doer [task doer’s name] from one star to five stars , the message will also let them know that it’s mandatory for them to rate the task doer before gaining access to use taskifii again, the message will also let them that if they click the first star button , it means their experience with the task doer was Very poor or unsatisfactory,  but  if they click the second star button it means their experience with the task doer was Poor or below expectations,  but if they click the Third star button it means their experience with the task doer was Average or met expectations,  but if they click the fourth star button it means their experience with the task doer was good or exceeded their expectations,  but if they click the 5th star button it means their experience with the task doer was excellent or outstanding. Then If the task doer clicks one of the 5 buttons , the color of the inside part of the star in the button clicked will turn to yellow as well as the ones before it (this is ofcourse if there any before it i.e if the user clicks the first star button in the left of the user’s point of view , the only star in a button in which the color  inside of the star will change to yellow will only be the first one that was clicked on because there is nothing before it) , then the buttons will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then a message (This message has an amharic version) will  be sent to the task doer letting them know that they have successfully rated the task creator , the message will also let them know that taskifii hopes they(the task doer) have enjoyed using the taskifii. But if the task creator clicks one of the 5 buttons , the color of the inside part of the star in the button clicked will turn to yellow as well as the ones before it (this is ofcourse if there any i.e if the user clicks the first star button in the left of the user’s point of view , the only star in a button in which the color  inside of the star will change to yellow will only be the first one that was clicked on because there is nothing before it), then the buttons will stop doing anything if they get clicked,  a message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that they have successfully rated the task doer , the message will also let them know that taskifii hopes they(the task creator) have enjoyed using the taskifii. 

 But if the task doer clicks the deny button before the 5 minutes are up, a message (This message has an amharic version)  with two buttons attached below it labeled as “Give a Week” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Report to Taskifii” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task doer letting them know that sometimes it might be network reasons or transaction delay reasons  so if they want to give it a week till the money potentially arrives to their bank account ,  they can click the give a week button , the message will also let them know that if they click the give a week button , they and the task creator [the task creator’s name] won’t be able to use taskifii till they either recieve the taskfee (and notify taskifii that they recieved it) within a week or till the week is up in which taskifii will get to the bottom of this and punish the one who is found guilty , the message will also let them know that if they want the taskifii team to get to the bottom of this as soon as possible, they can click the report to taskifii button, the message will aslo let them know that the taskifii team is a bit busy with other reports like theirs so they shall wait till taskifii studies their case , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this and reaches out to them, the message will also warn them to click one of the buttons below within 5 minutes otherwise taskifii will assume that they recieved the task fee. And a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has denied that they have recieved the task fee so now they (the task creator) must wait to see if the task doer either wishes to wait a week to recieve the task fee or report this case to taskifii. Then if the task doer clicks the give a week button  ,  the give a week button and the report to taskifii button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked , then a message (This message has an amharic version) with two buttons attached below it labeled as “Received” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Report to Taskifii” (This button label has an amharic version) (yes, this button will do the same thing as the one before in which i will tell you later what it does if it gets clicked)   will be sent to the task doer letting them know that they must click the received button if they have received the task fee before the week is up, the message will also let them know that once the week is up and they haven’t clicked the received button , taskifii will study this case and give the right measurement to whomever is found guilty, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they recieve the task fee and click the recieved button within a week or till taskifii studies this case(if they clicked the report to taskifii button ). But i before i continue i want you to know that from earlier if it was a situation where the task doer doesn’t click the give a week button or the report to taskifii button next to it in time (the time i told you earlier) or even now if the task doer clicks the recieved button within a week (i know it’s confusing what i said but since both of these have the same result i decided to tell you what happens if either of the things happen), the buttons(if the task doer didn’t click the give a week button or the report to taskifii button within a week ,  the give a week button and the report to taskifii button is what i mean by buttons here  but if the task doer where in the stage where they clicked the recieved button within a week , the recieved button and the report to taskifii button next to it is what i mean by buttons here) will now stop doing anything if they get clicked , then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) with 5 buttons (This button label has an amharic version) attached below it (each labeled with star emoji that in which the color inside the star is not yellow but the color of the button meaning this “ ☆”, and the buttons must be arranged in one horizontal line in which every buttons are next to each other) to the task doer and the task creator, the message (This message has an amharic version)  sent to the task doer will congratulate them in their success of finishing and delivering the completed task, the message will also thank them for doing their part and using taskifii, the message will also let them know that taskifii is happy to include  [the task doer’s name] as a trustworthy , responsible and valuable member of Taskifii , the message will also let them know that they have reached the final stage in which they have to rate the task creator [task creator’s name] from one star to five stars , the message will also let them know that it’s mandatory for them to rate the task creator before gaining access to use taskifii again, the message will also let them  that if they click the first star , it means  their experience with the task Creator was Very poor or unsatisfactory,  but if they click the second star button it means their experience with the task Creator was Poor or below expectations,  but if they click the Third star button it means their experience with the task Creator was Average or met expectations,  but if they click the fourth star button it means their experience with the task Creator was good or exceeded their expectations,  but if they click the 5th start button it means their experience with the task creator was excellent or outstanding, and the message (This message has an amharic version)  sent to the task creator will congratulate them in their success of delegating a task, the message will also thank them for doing their part, the message will also let them know that taskifii is  happy to include them [the task creator’s name ] as a trustworthy and valuable member of taskifii,  the message will also let them know that they have reached the final stage in which they have to rate the task doer [task doer’s name] from one star to five stars , the message will also let them know that it’s mandatory for them to rate the task doer before gaining access to use taskifii again, the message will also let them that if they click the first star button , it means their experience with the task doer was Very poor or unsatisfactory,  but  if they click the second star button it means their experience with the task doer was Poor or below expectations,  but if they click the Third star button it means their experience with the task doer was Average or met expectations,  but if they click the fourth star button it means their experience with the task doer was good or exceeded their expectations,  but if they click the 5th star button it means their experience with the task doer was excellent or outstanding. Then If the task doer clicks one of the 5 buttons , the color of the inside part of the star in the button clicked will turn to yellow as well as the ones before it (this is ofcourse if there any before it i.e if the user clicks the first star button in the left of the user’s point of view , the only star in a button in which the color  inside of the star will change to yellow will only be the first one that was clicked on because there is nothing before it) , then the buttons will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then a message (This message has an amharic version) will  be sent to the task doer letting them know that they have successfully rated the task creator , the message will also let them know that taskifii hopes they(the task doer) have enjoyed using the taskifii. But if the task creator clicks one of the 5 buttons , the color of the inside part of the star in the button clicked will turn to yellow as well as the ones before it (this is ofcourse if there any i.e if the user clicks the first star button in the left of the user’s point of view , the only star in a button in which the color  inside of the star will change to yellow will only be the first one that was clicked on because there is nothing before it), then the buttons will stop doing anything if they get clicked,  a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that they have successfully rated the task doer , the message will also let them know that taskifii hopes they(the task creator) have enjoyed using the taskifii. But if the task doer would have clicked the report to taskifii button (either one i.e if the task doer clicked the report to taskifii button within 5 minutes rather than clicking the give a week button next to it within 5 minutes or if the task doer would have clicked the report to taskifii button within a week rather than clicking the recieved button next to it within a week ) or if the task doer would have not clicked the recieved button or the report to taskifii button next to it within a week , the buttons (if the task doer would have clicked the report to taskifii button next to the give a week button within the 5 minutes  ,  the give a week button and the report to taskifii button is what i mean by buttons here  but if the task doer where in the stage where they clicked the report to taskifii button next to the received button within a week , the recieved button and the report to taskifii button next to it is what i mean by buttons here)will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then  a message (This message has an amharic version)  will be sent  to the task doer letting them know that  taskifii has been notified about the report so they must wait till  taskifii studies this case and gets back to them(the task doers)  in which they(the task doer) can’t use taskifii till then . A message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has reported to taskifii that the task creator( in the message it will say “you”) did not send the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they shall wait till taskifii studies this case and gets back to them  in which they(the task creator) can’t use taskifii till then. Then the bot will ban the task doer and the task creator from using the bot as well as the group(the group i told you about earlier). Then the Task post without the apply button, the related file(if the task creator gave a related file) , the completed task the task doer sent, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the  task creator’s phone number with emphasis, and the receipt the task creator sent will all be sent to another private channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has  Five buttons attached below it labeled as “Contact Task Doer” , “Contact Task Creator”, “keep blocking task doer”, “keep blocking task creator”, and “Completed” . And the giant message will have two hashtags in it saying “#UnPaid” and “#UnCompleted” .  And if the contact task doer  button is clicked ,  it will take the user that clicked it, to the bot ,  and then  a message  will be sent to the user  through the bot  letting them know  that they should write a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then  if the user gives a message  or anything else,  it will be sent to the task doer.  But if the user clicks the contact task Creator button,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then a message will be sent to the user through the bot letting them know that they should write a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or anything else,  it would be sent to the task creator . 
 But  if the keep blocking task doer  button was clicked  by a user,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user  letting them know  that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task doer.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task doer later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task doer (i will explain how next) . Then  the bot  will send to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month” . And  then  if the user clicks  the day button , the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 days).  But if the user clicked the month button,  the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of months they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning  the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task doer is banned/kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task doer will then get 5 one-star reviews as if  5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task creator, the task creator  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator five-star reviews. Then in the giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task doer” (written in red color).  But if a user clicks the unblock task doer button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task doer . Then the bot will unban the task doer from the bot as well as the group.  But if a user clicked the keep blocking task creator button , it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task creator.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task creator later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task creator (i will explain how next). Then  the bot  will send  to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month”.  And then if the user clicks the day button , the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to keep on banning the task creator. Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 days). Then if the user gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier, then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task creator is kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task creator will then get 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task doer, the task doer  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-star reviews. Then in the then giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task creator” (written in Blue color). But if a user clicks the unblock task creator button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task creator . Then the bot will unban the task creator from the bot as well as the group. Okay but if the completed button is clicked , it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. I also want you to know that if the giant message will then have the text “The guilty is the task creator” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task creator button) and for the second time in the future, if the task creator gets the report to taskifii button clicked by a task doer on a task they posted , the then giant message will  have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task creator”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task creator again” , then the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task doer [half the task fee they(the task creator) planned to pay the first victim task doer] birr and till they pay the second victimized task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) were supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr , the message will also include both of the task doer’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doers, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task doer) letting them know that taskifii has found the task creator guilty so the task creator [task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii  . And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task doer a message letting them know that a previous task creator they have worked with in the past by the name [task creator’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task creator) did to them (the task doer) in the past to another task doer , the message will also let them know that because the task creator repeated their mistake again , the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they pay half of the task fee they were supposed to pay them (the task doer) to them (the task doer) plus another corresponding task fee to the other task doer, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task creator sends the monetary punishment they (the task doer) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task creator to only click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task doer, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they send as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that they must now send the receipt of payment for the second victimized task doer. Then if the task creator gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will exactly wait till the first victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task doer the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version), and the message will let them know that a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name] has finally sent the punishment fee of [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the first victimized task doer] birr to them(the first victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will also wait exactly till the second victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then bot will send to the second victimized task doer the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “ I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task creator was supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr to them(the second victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will ban(or keep on banning) the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s telegram username, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to first victimized task doer], the task creator’s telegram username, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#FVTD” ,and “#unpaid2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button (which i will explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (first victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews each as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task doer would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task doer clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (and obviously fyi ,this sent button will appear  if the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens with more details , for now just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message(This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because both the task doers have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. Then also the bot will give the task creator 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews and the bot will also give both the task doer 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creator gave the task doer five-stars.And btw ,I forgot to tell you that ,as soon as the first victimized task doer or the second victimized task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task doer would have clicked the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task doer  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then the second receipt , the second victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s telegram username,  the second victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis ,the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to second victimized task doer] birr,  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#SVTD” ,and “#unpaid2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button  is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doers five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task creator again” text in it  and  for the third time or more in the future, if the task creator gets the report to taskifii button clicked by a task doer on a task they posted , then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttc”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task creator is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttc button , the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e making the task doer fix a mistake outside of the task description) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) was going to pay by the task doer] birr , the message will also include the task doer’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that after taskifii studied the case , the task creator has been found guilty so the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer). And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task creator to click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task creator) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), the bot will exactly wait till the task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,then the bot will send to the task doer the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the task doer] birr to them (the task doer), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task doer’s name with emphasis ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the task creator’s name with emphasis, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task creator’s email address with emphasis, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#TD” ,and “#unpaid3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions.  And as i told you before, the task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because  the task doer have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then also the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 



Okay going back now, I also want you to know that if the giant message would have had the text “The guilty is the task doer” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task doer button) and next time if the task doer gets in the situation like this for the for the second time in the future (i.e in the future for the second time, if the task doer clicks the report to taskifii button for another task)   , the then giant message  sent will have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task doer”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task doer again”,  then the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first or the former victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr and till they pay the second or the current victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task creator) letting them know that taskifii has found the task doer guilty so the task doer [task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee/ monetary punishment fee to them(the task creators), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii. And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task creator a message letting them know that a previous task doer they have worked with in the past by the name [task doer’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task doer) did to them (the task creator) in the past to another task creator(a.k.a the second victimized task creator) , the message will also let them know that because the task doer repeated their mistake again , the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half of the task fee they were supposed to get paid by  them (the task creator)initially  to them (the task creator) plus another corresponding monetary punishment fee to the other task creator, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task doer sends the monetary punishment fee they (the task creator) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that they must give the receipt of payment for the second victimized task creator . Then if the task doer gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will wait exactly till the first victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task creator the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr to them(the first victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then also when the second victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,  bot will send to the second victimized task creator the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator] birr to them(the second victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t, they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task creator’s name with emphasis ,the first victimized task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the first victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr,  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#FVTC” ,and “#unpaid2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the first victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist),  the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( first victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews.

But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (this is ofcourse if the second victimized task creator clicked the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens, just know there is a sent button involved in it ) (btw the same goes vice versa i.e if a user clicked the sent button or if the second victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the first victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that because both the task creators have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the first victimized task creator or the second victimized task creator clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button,both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task creator  will be unbanned from the bot and the group, then  the second receipt , the second victimized task creator’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis ,the second victimized task creator’s telegram username ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee of the task the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator],  task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”.

And if the task doer would have clicked the non-agreed upon button before the time to click the non-agreed upon button was up, a message with a button attached below it labeled as “Cancel this report” will be sent to the task doer letting them know that they should send a message that explains at least one thing that is a non agreed upon work outside of the task description that the task creator insisted them(the task doer) to fix in the completed task/50% of it , the message will also let them know that they got 5 minutes to send the message or they won’t get another chance to report this. Then if the task doer doesn’t send a message within 5 minutes or if the task doer clicks the cancel this report button within 5 minutes   , the cancel this report button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked , then the bot will wait till the task doer sends the updated and completed task before the revision time is up, in which if they do or not , the exact same thing or process will happen as i told earlier (i.e the process  i told you of what happens if the task doer sends the updated and completed task before the revision time is up rather than clicking the non agreed upon button ).  But if the task doer would have sent a message or something to the bot within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button ,  the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has claimed that the task creator (in the message it will say “you”) is insisting them(the task doer) to fix something that is a non agreed upon extra work outside of the task description,  the message will also let them know that taskifii will get to the bottom of this and punish the one who is found guilty, the message will also let the task creator know that the taskifii team has a lot complaints like this to resolve so it might take a while till taskifii studies this case , the message will also let them know that they (the task creator) can’t unfortunately use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this.  And also from the task doer side a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent letting them know that they have successfully sent the report claim to taskifii, the message will also let them know that they shall wait till taskifii team studies this case and gets to the bottom of it , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this. Then both the task doer and the task creator will be banned from using both the group and this bot until i can study this case and confirm the one who is guilty and the way this happens is once the task doer gives a message or anything within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button , the message or something the task creator sent within first 50% of the revision time after clicking the fix button , the message the task doer sent within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button , the related file (if there is any), the task post without the apply button, the task doer’s name with emphasis ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, and the  task creator’s phone number with emphasis will all be sent to another channel (which has the chat id :--1002432632907) as one giant message(which will have two hashtags in it saying “#nonagreedupon” and “#UnCompleted”) with seven buttons  attached below it labeled as “Contact Task Doer” , “Contact Task Creator”, “ keep blocking task doer”, “keep blocking task creator”, “Unblock task doer”, “Unblock Task creator” and “Completed” .  And if the contact task doer  button is clicked ,  it will take the user that clicked it, to the bot ,  and then  a message  will be sent to the user  through the bot  letting them know  that they should write a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then  if the user gives a message  or anything else,  it will be sent to the task doer.  But if the user clicks the contact task Creator button,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then a message will be sent to the user through the bot letting them know that they should write a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or anything else,  it would be sent to the task creator . 
 But  if the keep blocking task doer  button was clicked  by a user,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user  letting them know  that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task doer.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task doer later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task doer (i will explain how next) . Then  the bot  will send to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month” . And  then  if the user clicks  the day button , the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 days).  But if the user clicked the month button,  the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of months they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning  the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task doer is banned/kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task doer will then get 5 one-star reviews as if  5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task creator, the task creator  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator five-star reviews. Then in the giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task doer” (written in red color).  But if a user clicks the unblock task doer button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task doer . Then the bot will unban the task doer from the bot as well as the group.  But if a user clicked the keep blocking task creator button , it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task creator.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task creator later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task creator (i will explain how next). Then  the bot  will send  to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month”.  And then if the user clicks the day button , the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to keep on banning the task creator. Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 days). Then if the user gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier, then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task creator is kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task creator will then get 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task doer, the task doer  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-star reviews. Then in the then giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task creator” (written in Blue color). But if a user clicks the unblock task creator button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task creator . Then the bot will unban the task creator from the bot as well as the group. Okay but if the completed button is clicked , it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. I also want you to know that if the giant message will then have the text “The guilty is the task creator” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task creator button) and for the second time ,if the task creator gets a non agreed upon report from a task doer in the future (i.e if task doer sends a message within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button) , the giant message will then have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task creator”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task creator again” , then the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task doer [half the task fee they(the task creator) planned to pay the first victim task doer] birr and till they pay the second victimized task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) were supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr , the message will also include both of the task doer’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doers, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task doer will be un banned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task doer) letting them know that taskifii has found the task creator guilty so the task creator [task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii  . And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task doer a message letting them know that a previous task creator they have worked with in the past by the name [task creator’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task creator) did to them (the task doer) in the past to another task doer , the message will also let them know that because the task creator repeated their mistake again , the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they pay half of the task fee they were supposed to pay them (the task doer) to them (the task doer) plus another corresponding task fee to the other task doer, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task creator sends the monetary punishment they (the task doer) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task creator to only click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task doer, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they send as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that they must now send the receipt of payment for the second victimized task doer. Then if the task creator gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will exactly wait till the first victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task doer the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version), and the message will let them know that a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name] has finally sent the punishment fee of [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the first victimized task doer] birr to them(the first victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will also wait exactly till the second victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then bot will send to the second victimized task doer the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “ I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task creator was supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr to them(the second victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will ban(or keep on banning) the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s telegram username, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to first victimized task doer], the task creator’s telegram username, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#FVTD” ,and “#nonagreedupon2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button (which i will explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (first victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews each as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task doer would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task doer clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (and obviously fyi ,this sent button will appear  if the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens with more details , for now just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message(This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because both the task doers have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. Then also the bot will give the task creator 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews and the bot will also give both the task doer 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creator gave the task doer five-stars.And btw ,I forgot to tell you that ,as soon as the first victimized task doer or the second victimized task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task doer would have clicked the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task doer  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then the second receipt , the second victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s telegram username,  the second victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis ,the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to second victimized task doer] birr,  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#SVTD” ,and “#nonagreedupon2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button  is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doers five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task creator again” text in it  and for the third time or more ,if the task creator gets a non agreed upon report from a task doer in the future (i.e for the third time or more in the future , if a task doer sends a message within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button for a task), then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttc”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task creator is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttc button , the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e trying to make the task doer fix a mistake that wasn’t theirs) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) was going to pay by the task doer] birr , the message will also include the task doer’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that after taskifii studied the case , the task creator has been found guilty so the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer).

Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews.

And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 



Okay going back now, I also want you to know that if the giant message would have had the text “The guilty is the task doer” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task doer button) and for the second time  ,if the task doer gives a non agreed upon report in in the future (i.e for the second time in the future , if the task doer sends a message within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button) , the then giant message  sent will have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task doer”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task doer again”,  then the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first or the former victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr and till they pay the second or the current victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task creator) letting them know that taskifii has found the task doer guilty so the task doer [task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee/ monetary punishment fee to them(the task creators), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii. And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task creator a message letting them know that a previous task doer they have worked with in the past by the name [task doer’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task doer) did to them (the task creator) in the past to another task creator(a.k.a the second victimized task creator) , the message will also let them know that because the task doer repeated their mistake again , the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half of the task fee they were supposed to get paid by  them (the task creator)initially  to them (the task creator) plus another corresponding monetary punishment fee to the other task creator, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task doer sends the monetary punishment fee they (the task creator) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that they must give the receipt of payment for the second victimized task creator . Then if the task doer gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will wait exactly till the first victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task creator the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr to them(the first victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then also when the second victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,  bot will send to the second victimized task creator the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator] birr to them(the second victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t, they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task creator’s name with emphasis ,the first victimized task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the first victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr,  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#FVTC” ,and “#nonagreedupon2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the first victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist),  the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( first victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (this is ofcourse if the second victimized task creator clicked the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens, just know there is a sent button involved in it ) (btw the same goes vice versa i.e if a user clicked the sent button or if the second victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the first victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that because both the task creators have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the first victimized task creator or the second victimized task creator clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button,both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task creator  will be unbanned from the bot and the group, then  the second receipt , the second victimized task creator’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis ,the second victimized task creator’s telegram username ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee of the task the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator],  task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#SVTC” ,and “#nonagreedupon2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions.

Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars each . Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task doer again” text in it  and for the third time or more ,if the task doer gives a non agreed upon report  in the future (i.e for the third time or morein the future , if the task doer sends a message within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button for a task), then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttd”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task doer is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttd button , the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e lying by saying that the task creator insisted them(the task doer) fix a mistake that wasn’t theirs to fix) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the task creator] birr , the message will also include  task creator’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that after taskifii studied the case ,the task doer has been found guilty so the task doer  has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creator). And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task doer) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt .

The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#TC” ,and “#nonagreedupon3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews.

I also forgot to tell you that if the the task doer clicked the approve button in which the task doer sent the first 50% of the completed task after the time given for the task is up (till task fee reaches zero amount), the same thing will happen as if the task doer clicked the approve button in which the task doer sent the first 50% of the completed time within the time given for the task (which i explained earlier), But the only difference here is that task fee amount is different (read the whole instructions to understand) and couple of other stuffs.
And btw i forgot to tell you that if the task doer wouldn’t have sent the completed task at all,  even within the time given for the task or even after that (i.e till task fee reaches zero) or if the task doer wouldn’t have sent the updated and completed task within 50% of the revision time, a message will be sent to the task doer letting them know that they have been banned from taskifii for 5 months for not meeting their obligations, the message will also let them know that if they repeat this action again , there will be some monetary punishment to pay. Then the bot will ban the task doer from the bot and the group for 5 months. Then after the 5 months are up (i.e after the task doer is no longer banned from the bot and the group), the Bot will send a message to the task doer letting them know that they can now start using taskifii ,  the message will also let them know that they should be careful in not repeating this action again otherwise next time there would be monetary punishments to pay. If the task doer repeats this mistake for the second time again i.e not send the completed task at all (i.e if they don’t send the completed task neither within the time given for the task nor after that ,till task fee reaches zero),  the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victim task creator] birr and till they pay the second victim task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victim task creator and the second task creator letting them know that the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creators). And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt .

Then if the task doer gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) and when the first victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , the bot will send to the first victimized task creator the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr to them(the first victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button.

And btw , as soon as the first victimized task creator or the second victimized task creator clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task creator  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then  the second receipt , the second victimized task creator’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis ,the second victimized task creator’s telegram username ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee of the task the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator],  task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#SVTC” ,and “#undelivered2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars each . Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 
If the task doer repeats this mistake ( i.e not send the completed task at all (i.e if they don’t send the completed task neither within the time given for the task nor after that ,till task fee reaches zero) ) for the third time or more, the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has completed studying the case and taskifii has found them guilty by a situation like this for the third time or more (i.e not sending the completed task at all ( neither within the time given for the task nor after that ,till task fee reaches zero) for the third time or more ) so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the task creator] birr , the message will also include  task creator’s name(with emphasis) and all their (the task creator’s) banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creator). And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task doer) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), when the task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , the bot will send to the task creator the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator] birr to them (the task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task creator’s name with emphasis ,the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#TC” ,and “#undelivered3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because  the task creator have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task creator  clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 

Now moving on, If the task had the 30%:40%:30% payment-task exchange strategy on it and if a accepted task doer clicks the do the task button, a message (This message has an amharic version) that might also include a button attached below it labeled as “Violation” (This button label has an amharic version)  (this button will only exist if the the task creator gave a related file earlier in the task inquiry format and also in which if they did, the related file the task creator gave earlier will be attached above the message ) will be sent to the task doer letting them know that they have to now start doing the task, the message will also let them know that they have [ the time given to complete task] to finish and submit the whole of the completed task bit by bit here (in the bot), the message will also let them know that it will be recommended if  they can first send the first 30% of the completed task within [the first 30% of the time given for the task]. And if there is a related file , the message will also let them know that the task creator also gave the file above that have a  relation to the task ,  the message will also let them know that if the related  file has some other instructions or more work for them to do that is outside the task description, they can choose not to do it by reporting(i like to call it a violation report) it to taskifii  by clicking the violation button below, The message will also let them know that if they click the violation button, they will give a reason why , then the issue will be studied by taskifii and if there is no problem found(meaning if the related file doesn’t have more  instructions or work not described in the task description)  , they will be strictly banned from using taskifii for a while plus if they do the same mistake again next time , there would be a monetary punishment to pay to use taskifii again, the message will also let them know that if they intend to click the violation button , they have to click it within [15% of the time given for the task ]. I will tell you what will happens if the violation button is clicked or not clicked but for now let’s move on. I want you to know that  after the do the task button is clicked ,the bot will also change a couple of details about the task post and that is that the text “Task is open!”  in the above section of the task post in the channel will change to “Task is taken!” (written in the ink color told you earlier) and also the apply button will disappear from the task post in the channel and also the accept & decline buttons of all apply posts the task creator has already received will disappear . And also all incoming apply posts will be canceled and also A message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to all the rest of the task doers that  applied and got accepted but didn’t click the do the task button before the first task doer that clicked the do the task button  letting them apologetically know that the task is taken by another task doer that clicked the do the task button quicker than them and they should have better luck and speed next time if they want to have a better chance, the message will also let them know that they should find other tasks to do . A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to all the rest of the task doers that applied but didn’t get neither accepted nor declined and all the rest of  task doers that were applying(i.e if they were in the application format(which will also cancel the application format)) letting them apologetically know that the task creator has chosen another task doer to do the task so they should move on and find other tasks to do. And all the rest  of  task doers that were applying(i.e if they were in the application format) only for this will have their application format stop doing anything(essentially meaning the application process or format will be canceled because the task creator already found a task doer) and if there were buttons in their stage of application format, the buttons will now stop doing anything if they get clicked. Moving on, after  the do the task button was clicked ,  The do the task button and the cancel button from earlier will also now  stop doing anything (if they get clicked) for all the task doers that got accepted including the one that clicked the do the task button first. And also if more than one  accepted task doers clicks the do the task button at exactly the same time, the bot will randomly choose one of them as the one that clicked the do the task button first.  And also the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has begun doing the task , the message will also let them know that if the task doer sends the completed task , it will then be sent to them(the task creators) here through the bot ,  the message will also let them know  that the task doer has [time given for the task] to finish the task. And also on the task doers side , the bot will make the violation button stop doing anything when clicked if no one clicks it before 15% of the time given for the task has passed , not only this but if the time has passed (i.e after the first 15% of the time given for the task has passed) and if the task doer clicks the violation button after the time has passed , only for the first click, a message (This message has an amharic version)  will be sent to the task doer letting them know that their time to click the violation button is up so they should finish doing the task and submit it within the time given.  But then If the task doer clicks the violation button in time, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  with a button attached below it  labeled as “ Cancel Report” (This button label has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them  know taskifii will get to the bottom of this but taskifii needs their (the task doer’s ) help by telling taskifii at least one thing in the related file (or the file the task creator attached to the task) that creates more work not described in the task description,  the message  will  also let them know  that they got 5 minutes to give that  reason or more , otherwise they will be obligated to complete the task,  the message will also let them know that the 5 minutes is a part of the time given to finish and submit the task so they must be sure about it , the message will also let them know that if they are not sure about it and want to change their idea, they can click the Cancel report button below quickly ,The message will also let them know that once they click the cancel report button ,there's no going Back  meaning no more  getting a chance  to report something in the related file that causes more work not described in task description. 
And then if the task doer sends a message or something within the 5 minutes , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has claimed that the task creator (in the message it will say “you”) has included non agreed upon extra work in the file  that the task creator  (in the message it will say “you”)  attached , the message will also let them know that taskifii will get to the bottom of this and punish the one who is found guilty, the message will also let the task creator know that the taskifii team has a lot complaints like this to resolve so  it might take a while til taskifii studies this case , the message will also let them know that they (the task creator) can’t unfortunately use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this.  And also from the task doer side a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent letting them know that they have successfully sent the violation report to taskifii, the message will also let them know that they shall wait till taskifii team studies this case and gets to the bottom of it , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this. Then both the task doer and the task creator will be banned from using both the group (which has this chat id: “-1002239730204”)( and btw  later on ,if i say group , i mean this group with this chat id) and this bot until i can study this case and confirm the one who is guilty and the way this happens is once the task doer gives a message or anything within 5 minutes after clicking the violation button(which we have discussed earlier) , the related file, the task post without the apply button, the task doer’s name with emphasis ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the  task creator’s phone number with emphasis,  and  the message or whatever the task doer sent to the bot within 5 minutes after clicking the violation button will all be sent to another channel (which has the chat id :--1002432632907) as one giant message(which will have two hashtags in it saying “#Violation” and “#UnCompleted”) with seven buttons  attached below it labeled as “Contact Task Doer” , “Contact Task Creator”, “ keep blocking task doer”, “keep blocking task creator”, “Unblock task doer”, “Unblock Task creator” and “Completed” .  And if the contact task doer  button is clicked ,  it will take the user that clicked it, to the bot ,  and then  a message  will be sent to the user  through the bot  letting them know  that they should write a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then  if the user gives a message  or anything else,  it will be sent to the task doer.  But if the user clicks the contact task Creator button,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then a message will be sent to the user through the bot letting them know that they should write a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or anything else,  it would be sent to the task creator . 
 But  if the keep blocking task doer  button was clicked  by a user,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user  letting them know  that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task doer.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task doer later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task doer (i will explain how next) . Then  the bot  will send to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month” . And  then  if the user clicks  the day button , the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 days).  But if the user clicked the month button,  the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of months they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning  the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task doer is banned/kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task doer will then get 5 one-star reviews as if  5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task creator, the task creator  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator five-star reviews. Then in the giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task doer” (written in red color).  But if a user clicks the unblock task doer button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task doer . Then the bot will unban the task doer from the bot as well as the group.  But if a user clicked the keep blocking task creator button , it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task creator.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task creator later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task creator (i will explain how next). Then  the bot  will send  to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month”.  And then if the user clicks the day button , the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to keep on banning the task creator. Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 days). Then if the user gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier, then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task creator is kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task creator will then get 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task doer, the task doer  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-star reviews. Then in the then giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task creator” (written in Blue color). But if a user clicks the unblock task creator button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task creator . Then the bot will unban the task creator from the bot as well as the group. Okay but if the completed button is clicked , it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. I also want you to know that if the giant message will then have the text “The guilty is the task creator” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task creator button) and next time if the task creator gets a violation report for the second time , the giant message will then have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task creator”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task creator again” , then the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task doer [half the task fee they(the task creator) planned to pay the first victim task doer] birr and till they pay the second victimized task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) were supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr , the message will also include both of the task doer’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doers, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task doer will be un banned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task doer) letting them know that taskifii has found the task creator guilty so the task creator [task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii  . And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task doer a message letting them know that a previous task creator they have worked with in the past by the name [task creator’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task creator) did to them (the task doer) in the past to another task doer , the message will also let them know that because the task creator repeated their mistake again , the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they pay half of the task fee they were supposed to pay them (the task doer) to them (the task doer) plus another corresponding task fee to the other task doer, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task creator sends the monetary punishment they (the task doer) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task creator to only click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task doer, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they send as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that they must now send the receipt of payment for the second victimized task doer. Then if the task creator gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will exactly wait till the first victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task doer the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version), and the message will let them know that a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name] has finally sent the punishment fee of [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the first victimized task doer] birr to them(the first victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will also wait exactly till the second victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then bot will send to the second victimized task doer the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “ I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task creator was supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr to them(the second victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will ban(or keep on banning) the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s telegram username, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to first victimized task doer], the task creator’s telegram username, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#FVTD” ,and “#violationguilty2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button (which i will explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (first victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews each as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task doer would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task doer clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (and obviously fyi ,this sent button will appear  if the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens with more details , for now just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message(This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because both the task doers have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. Then also the bot will give the task creator 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews and the bot will also give both the task doer 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creator gave the task doer five-stars.And btw ,I forgot to tell you that ,as soon as the first victimized task doer or the second victimized task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task doer would have clicked the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task doer  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then the second receipt , the second victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s telegram username,  the second victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis ,the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to second victimized task doer] birr,  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#SVTD” ,and “#violationguilty2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button  is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doers five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task creator again” text in it  and if the task creator gets the violation report for the third time or more in the future , then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttc”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task creator is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttc button , the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e adding non agreed upon extra work in the related file) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) was going to pay by the task doer] birr , the message will also include the task doer’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that after taskifii studied the case , the task creator has been found guilty so the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer). And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task creator to click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task creator) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), the bot will exactly wait till the task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,then the bot will send to the task doer the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the task doer] birr to them (the task doer), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task doer’s name with emphasis ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the task creator’s name with emphasis, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task creator’s email address with emphasis, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#TD” ,and “#violationreport3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because  the task doer have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then also the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii.

And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 



Okay going back now, I also want you to know that if the giant message would have had the text “The guilty is the task doer” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task doer button) and next time if the task doer gives a violation report for the second time again  (i.e by clicking the violation button and then sending a message within 5 minutes) , the giant message  sent will have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task doer”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task doer again”,  then the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first or the former victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr and till they pay the second or the current victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task creator) letting them know that taskifii has found the task doer guilty so the task doer [task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee/ monetary punishment fee to them(the task creators), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii. And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task creator a message letting them know that a previous task doer they have worked with in the past by the name [task doer’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task doer) did to them (the task creator) in the past to another task creator(a.k.a the second victimized task creator) , the message will also let them know that because the task doer repeated their mistake again , the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half of the task fee they were supposed to get paid by  them (the task creator)initially  to them (the task creator) plus another corresponding monetary punishment fee to the other task creator, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task doer sends the monetary punishment fee they (the task creator) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt .

Then also when the second victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,  bot will send to the second victimized task creator the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator] birr to them(the second victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t, they must click the i deny button.

And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task creator  will be unbanned from the bot and the group, then  the second receipt , the second victimized task creator’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis ,the second victimized task creator’s telegram username ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee of the task the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator],  task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”.

And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task doer again” text in it  and if the task doer gives the violation report for the third time or more in the future , then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttd”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task doer is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttd button , the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e give a violation report while they were the ones who were the guilty ones by giving a false alarm violation report) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the task creator] birr , the message will also include  task creator’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that after taskifii studied the case ,the task doer has been found guilty so the task doer  has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creator). And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task doer) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), when the task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , the bot will send to the task creator the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator] birr to them (the task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task creator’s name with emphasis ,the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#TC” ,and “#violationreport3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because  the task creator have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task creator  clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 







       






 Okay going back now, i want you to know that after the task doer clicked the violation button, the bot will also keep on sending a separate message (This message has an amharic version)  every minute till the task doer either clicks the cancel report button within 5 minutes or till the task doer sends a message or something within 5 minutes or till the 5 minutes are up, and the message will essentially let them know how much time they got to send a message. 
But If the task doer doesn’t send a message or something within the 5 minutes after clicking the violation button, a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task doer letting them know that their time to give the message or violation report is up, the message will also let them know that they have to now only send the completed task or proof of task completion here to the bot  within[the remaining time till the time given for the task is up].Then  the cancel report button will stop doing anything if it gets clicked . Then the bot will wait for the task doer to send the completed task within the remaining time til the time given for the task is up(in which i will tell you later what happens if this happens or not) (and the bot will also do this if the task doer doesn’t click the violation button). And btw if you didn’t know by now,  as soon as the task doer clicked the do the task button,  in perfect circumstances(i.e if the task doer didn’t click the violation button and then send a message within 5 minutes after clicking it) ,the bot will wait for the task doer to send the completed task/30% of it  to the bot within the time given for the task.
 And before i tell you what happens if the task doer  sends the first 30% of the completed task within the time given for the task , i will first tell you What happens if the task Doer doesn’t send the task within the time given to  complete and submit the task(i.e. time given for task). But before i tell you it , i want you to know that the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer every 20% of the remaining time after the first 30% of the time given for the task has gone by, and the message will let the task doer know that they got [the remaining till the time given for the task is up] to submit the whole of the completed task to the bot so that they must send the first 30% of the task quickly. But the bot will only keep on sending this message to the task doer till either  the task doer sends the completed task/the first 30% to the bot within the time given for the task or till the time given for the task is up .   Okay moving on, If the task doer doesn’t send the completed task/the first 30% of the completed task within the time given for the task , an alertful message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task doer every 20% of the remaining time til the task fee reaches zero amount (sorry for confusing you, the reason why task fee will reach zero amount is because the birr amount deducted per hour from the task fee(the task creator would have given this earlier in task inquiry format) will start being deducted from the task fee every hour once the task doer missed the chance to send the completed within the time given to do the task) and the messages will be kept on being sent to the task doer til either the task doer sends the completed task or 30% of it within the remaining time till task fee reaches zero amount or till the task fee reaches zero, the message will warn them that they were late to submit the completed task so starting from the current time  [birr amount deducted  per hour from task fee] birr  (the task creator gave this  earlier in the task inquiry format) will be deducted from their task fee till either the task fee reaches zero birr amount or til they send the first 30% of the completed task, the message will also let them know that if the task fee reaches zero amount before they submit the first 30% of the completed task to the bot, they will be banned from using taskifii for 5 months and if they repeat this mistake again, there would be a monetary punishment to use taskifii again i.e they will pay half the task fee to the former victim task creator and the new victim task creator, the message  will also let them know that they got [the remaining time til the task fee reaches zero] to submit the task . 
And also an alertful message (This message has an amharic version)  will be sent to the task creator every 20% of the remaining time til the task fee reaches zero amount (the reason why it will reach zero amount is because the birr amount deducted per hour from the task fee (the task creator would have given this earlier) will start being deducted from the task fee every hour once the task doer missed the chance to send the completed task  with in the time given to do the task and til either the task doer sends the completed task within the remaining time till task fee reaches zero amount or till the task fee reaches zero amount) , and the message let’s them know that the task doer hasn’t  delivered the completed task within the time given for the task , the message will also let them know that  [ the birr amount deducted per hour from task fee] birr will be deducted from the task fee every hour till either the task fee reaches zero amount or til the task doer sends the first 30% of the completed task before the task fee reaches zero amount. 
Okay then if the task doer sends the first 30% of the completed task before the task fee reaches zero amount , firstly the bot will pause the time till task fee reaches zero amount(i will tell you when it will resume) ,then the first 30% of the completed task the task doer sent  would be sent to the task creator with a message (This message has an amharic version) attached  below it  and the message will have two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Fix” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Continue” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that the task doer has sent this 30% of the completed task to them,  the message will also let them know that they must check for any errors or mistakes  made by the task doer,  the message will also let them  that if they find  an   error or mistake  made by the task Doer ,they(the task creator) can notify and make the task Doer  fix whatever the error or mistake they(the task doer) made,  the message will also let them know that they got [the first 15% of the Revision Time] (the task doer gave earlier in the task inquiry) to click the fix button and give a message that will be sent to the  task doer to fix any mistakes they might have made ,  the message will also let them know that  the  task doer  will fix the mistakes  and send the updated and  completed task within [the remaining time til 30% of the revision time is up ], the  message will also let them know that if they click  the  continue button  it means that there is no error or mistake in the completed task the task doer sent ,  the message will also let them know that if they click the continue button,  it means  that they they want to move on ,  the message will also let them know  that if they don't click the fix button within [the first 15% of the revision time] , it's going to be taken as the completed task sent has no error or mistakes in it.  And also while this message is being sent to task creator, another message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task doer  letting them know that they have successfully sent 30% of the completed task,  the message will also let them know that the task Creator is reviewing and checking for any kind of errors or mistakes they(the task doer) might have made,  the message will also let them know that the task creator has [the first 15% of the revision time] to notify them(the task doers) about any kind of errors or mistakes they(the task doers) might have made so that they (task doers)can quickly fix them and send the updated ,correct and  completed task here (to the bot), the message will also let the task doer know that they must  wait attentively for at most [the first 15% of the revision time] til/ if the task creator notifies about a potential mistake or error they (the task doer) must fix so that they(the task doer) can use their remaining time effectively til the time given to send the updated and completed task is up  . Then after both this messages is sent to the receivers  , and then  if the task creator clicks the fix button  before the first 15% of the revision time has passed, a message (This message has an amharic version)  with a button attached below it labeled as “Accidental Request” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator letting them know that they should write  one message letting the task doer know every mistakes & errors they(the task doer) must fix, the message will also let them know that they must make everything clear for the task doer to understand , the message will also let them know that they got [the remaining time til the first 15% of the revision time is up] to send the message here(to the bot), the message will also let them know that if they click the accidental request button, it means they changed their minds to understanding that the 30% of the completed task doesn’t have any errors or mistakes. Before i continue , i forgot to tell you that a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator every 20 % of the first 15% of the revision time  till they either click the fix button or the continue button , and the message let’s them know how much time they got to click the fix button and notify the task doer any errors or mistakes to fix if there is any,  the message will also let them know that if they click the continue button before [the remaining time til the first 15% of the revision time is up] or if they don’t click any of the two buttons  within  [the remaining time till the first 15% of the  revision time is up],  it means that  there's no error or mistake  with the completed task the task doer has sent . Moving on,  as i told you earlier , if the task creator clicks the fix button, firstly the fix button and the continue button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, and then  a message (This message has an amharic version)  with the button attached below it  labeled as  “Accidental Request”  (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator, and i also told you what the message states but i forgot to tell you that after the task creator clicks the fix button , the bot will also send a separate message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator   every 20% of the remaining time till the first 15% of the revision time is up letting them know that they got [remaining time til the first 15% of the revision time is up] to send the message that notifies the task doer what mistakes or errors to fix; But also  the bot will only keep on sending this messages till either the first 15% of the revision time is up or till the task creator sends something(anything) to the bot before the first 15% of the revision time is up. Moving on, if the task creator clicks the fix button and  then sends a message or anything else that notifies the task Doer the mistakes they should fix within the time i stated earlier, the message or whatever the task creator sent plus a separate message (This message has an amharic version)  with a button attached below it labeled as “Non-Agreed upon” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent  to the task doer, and if it is a message the task creator sent, then it will be sent to the task doer in quotations letting the task doer know the task creator sent this message and the separate message sent to the task doer will let them(the task doer) know that the task creator wants them(the task doers) to fix the mistakes described above that they(the task doer) might have made , the separate message will also let them know that they got [ the remaining time til the first 30% of the  revision time is up] to submit the corrected and finalized task, the separate message will also let them know that if the task creator is trying to make them(the task doers) fix a mistake or error that they (the task doer) didn’t make i.e anything not described in the task description, they can click the non-agreed upon button below , the separate message will also let them know that if they plan to click the non-agreed upon button , they must click it within [the first 15% of the remaining time till 30% of the revision time is up]. A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the notification  is successfully sent to the task doer. Then if the task doer doesn’t click the non-agreed upon button within the first 15% of the remaining time till the first  30% of the revision time is up or if the task doer sends the updated and completed task within the first 15% of the remaining time till the first 30% of the revision time is up , the non-agreed upon button will stop doing anything .Then  if the task doer sends to the bot the updated and the completed task before 30% of the revision time is up , the updated and the completed task  and a separate message (This message has an amharic version)  below it that has two button below it labeled as “Not Fixed” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Fixed” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator , the message lets the task creator know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has sent the updated and the completed task above, the message also lets them know that if everything is fixed in the updated and the completed task, they can click the Fixed button below, but if something is not fixed in the  the updated and the completed task , they can click the Not Fixed button below, the message will also let them know that they must click one of the two buttons below within 20 minutes or taskifii will take it as if  they(the task creator) clicked the fix button. And also a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator every 5 minutes for 20 minutes or until the task creator clicks either button  letting them know how much time they got to click any of the two buttons till their 20 minutes are up .  Then if the task creator clicks the Fixed button within 20 minutes or if the task creator doesn’t click any of the two buttons within 20 minutes , same thing will happen as if the continue button was clicked(read the whole instructions to understand) i.e the fixed button and the continue button have the same function when clicked(the only difference they have is their button label, and also as you will see, when the continue button is clicked, the continue button and the fix button will then stop doing anything if they get clicked, but in this case , the fixed button and the not fixed button are the ones that will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, but all the rest of the things are the same) . But if the task creator clicks the not fixed button , the fixed button and the not fixed button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked , then a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator letting them know that this case will be studied by taskifii, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii reaches out to them. A message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that the task creator has claimed that something was not fixed in the updated and the completed task ,  the  message will also let them know that this case will be studied by taskifii, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii reaches out to them.  Then both the task doer and the task creator will be banned from using the bot and the group.  Then the Task post without the apply button, the related file(if the task creator gave a related file) , the completed task the task doer sent first, the updated and completed task the task doer sent , the notification message (or something else) the task creator sent that let the task doer know what errors or mistakes to fix,  the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the  task creator’s phone number with emphasis, and the receipt the task creator sent will all be sent to another private channel that has a chat id of “-1002432632907” as one giant message that has  Five buttons attached below it labeled as “Contact Task Doer” , “Contact Task Creator”, “ keep blocking task doer”, “keep blocking task creator”, and “Completed” . And the giant message will have two hashtags in it saying “#Mistake” and “#UnCompleted”  .And if the contact task doer  button is clicked ,  it will take the user that clicked it, to the bot ,  and then  a message  will be sent to the user  through the bot  letting them know  that they should write a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then  if the user gives a message  or anything else,  it will be sent to the task doer.  But if the user clicks the contact task Creator button,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then a message will be sent to the user through the bot letting them know that they should write a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or anything else,  it would be sent to the task creator . 
 But  if the keep blocking task doer  button was clicked  by a user,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user  letting them know  that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task doer.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task doer later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task doer (i will explain how next) . Then  the bot  will send to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month” . And  then  if the user clicks  the day button , the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 days).  But if the user clicked the month button,  the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of months they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning  the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task doer is banned/kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task doer will then get 5 one-star reviews as if  5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task creator, the task creator  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator five-star reviews. Then in the giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task doer” (written in red color).  But if a user clicks the unblock task doer button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task doer . Then the bot will unban the task doer from the bot as well as the group.  But if a user clicked the keep blocking task creator button , it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task creator.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task creator later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task creator (i will explain how next). Then  the bot  will send  to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month”.  And then if the user clicks the day button , the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to keep on banning the task creator. Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 days). Then if the user gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier, then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task creator is kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task creator will then get 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task doer, the task doer  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-star reviews. Then in the then giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task creator” (written in Blue color). But if a user clicks the unblock task creator button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task creator . Then the bot will unban the task creator from the bot as well as the group. Okay but if the completed button is clicked , it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. I also want you to know that if the giant message will then have the text “The guilty is the task creator” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task creator button) and next time if the task creator clicks the not fixed button for another task for the for the second time  , the then giant message will  have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task creator”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task creator again” , then the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task doer [half the task fee they(the task creator) planned to pay the first victim task doer] birr and till they pay the second victimized task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) were supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr , the message will also include both of the task doer’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doers, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task doer) letting them know that taskifii has found the task creator guilty so the task creator [task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii  . And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task doer a message letting them know that a previous task creator they have worked with in the past by the name [task creator’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task creator) did to them (the task doer) in the past to another task doer , the message will also let them know that because the task creator repeated their mistake again , the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they pay half of the task fee they were supposed to pay them (the task doer) to them (the task doer) plus another corresponding task fee to the other task doer, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task creator sends the monetary punishment they (the task doer) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task creator to only click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task doer, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they send as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that they must now send the receipt of payment for the second victimized task doer. Then if the task creator gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will exactly wait till the first victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task doer the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version), and the message will let them know that a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name] has finally sent the punishment fee of [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the first victimized task doer] birr to them(the first victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will also wait exactly till the second victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then bot will send to the second victimized task doer the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “ I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task creator was supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr to them(the second victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will ban(or keep on banning) the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s telegram username, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to first victimized task doer], the task creator’s telegram username, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#FVTD” ,and “#mistake2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button (which i will explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (first victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews each as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task doer would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task doer clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (and obviously fyi ,this sent button will appear  if the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens with more details , for now just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message(This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because both the task doers have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. Then also the bot will give the task creator 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews and the bot will also give both the task doer 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creator gave the task doer five-stars.And btw ,I forgot to tell you that ,as soon as the first victimized task doer or the second victimized task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task doer would have clicked the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task doer  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then the second receipt , the second victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s telegram username,  the second victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis ,the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to second victimized task doer] birr,  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#SVTD” ,and “#mistake2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions.

Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doers five-stars each .

Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task creator again” text in it  and if the task creator clicks the not fixed button for another task for the third time or more in the future , then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttc”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task creator is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttc button , the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e trying to make the task doer fix a mistake outside of the task description) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) was going to pay by the task doer] birr , the message will also include the task doer’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that after taskifii studied the case , the task creator has been found guilty so the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer). And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task creator to click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task creator) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt .

Okay going back now, I also want you to know that if the giant message would have had the text “The guilty is the task doer” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task doer button) and next time if the task doer gets in the situation like this for the for the second time in the future (i.e in the future for the second time, if a task creator clicks the not fixed button for a task  the task doer worked on/ was working on)   , the then giant message  sent will have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task doer”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task doer again”,  then the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first or the former victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr and till they pay the second or the current victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.

And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task creator  will be unbanned from the bot and the group, then  the second receipt , the second victimized task creator’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis ,the second victimized task creator’s telegram username ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee of the task the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator],  task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#SVTC” ,and “#mistake2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars each . Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task doer again” text in it  and if the task doer gets in the situation like this  for the third time or more in the future (i.e in the future for the third time or more, if a task creator clicks the not fixed button for a task the task doer worked on/was working on )  , then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttd”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task doer is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttd button , the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e not fixing the mistakes they made in the task in time) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the task creator] birr , the message will also include  task creator’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that after taskifii studied the case ,the task doer has been found guilty so the task doer  has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creator). And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task doer) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), when the task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , the bot will send to the task creator the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator] birr to them (the task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task creator’s name with emphasis ,the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#TC” ,and “#mistake3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because  the task creator have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task creator  clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 

If the task creator doesn’t click  the fix button or the continue button within the first 15% of the revision time or if the task creator  doesn’t send something to the bot nor click the accidental request button within the first 15% of the revision time after clicking the fix button or if the task creator clicks the accidental request button within the first 15% of the revision time after clicking the fix button or if the task creator clicks the continue button within the first 15% of the revision time or if the task creator clicks the fixed button or if the task creator clicks doesn’t click the fixed button or not fixed button within their times i told you earlier, the accidental request button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked(this is ofcourse if the task creator clicked the fix button but then after that ,did not either click the accidental request button within the first 15% of the revision time or send something to the bot with the first 15% of the revision time) ,then all the online banking details of the task doer , the task doer’s name , and a message (This message has an amharic version) below them will be sent to the task creator , the message will let the task creator know that they will choose the task doer’s online banking detail/s of their convenience above to send the task fee to them(the task doer) within exactly 30 minutes, the message will also let them know that after they send the money , they must send the the receipt here(to the bot) with in 30 minutes and that it doesn’t matter what format the receipt is (it can be a screenshot , pdf, link, ...etc…) . Then after all of this are sent to the task creator,  if the task creator sends something to the bot within 30 minutes,  whatever the task Creator sent to the bot  will be  sent to the task doer  with a message (This message has an amharic version)  and two buttons  attached below the message  labeled as “Approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Deny” (This button label has an amharic version),  the message  will let the task doer know that  the task creator has  claimed  that they ( the task creator)have sent  the task fee to  them (the task doer) ,  the message will also let them know that the task creator has sent  this file(whatever the task creator sent as a receipt)  as a proof that they have paid the task fee to them( the task  doer) ,  the message will also let them know that they must check if they have received the task fee  from the task creator  in which if they did , they can click the approve button below  but if they didn't receive any kind of task fee from the task creator,  they can click the deny button below, the message will also let them know that they got 5 minutes to click one of the buttons below otherwise taskifii will automatically assume that they (the task doer) have recieved the task fee so they must be quick to give an answer in 5 minutes, the message will also let them know that [the total birr amount deducted from the task fee before the task doer sent the completed task ] birr has been deducted from the task fee of [task fee] so they will get paid  [total birr amount deducted from the task fee before the task doer sent the completed task subtracted from the task fee] birr!. A message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the reciept has been successfully sent to the task doer , the message will also let them know that they must wait at most 5 minutes till the task doer confirms that they(the task doer) recieved the task fee.  And if the task doer clicks the approve button within the 5 minutes or if the task doer doesn’t click any of the two buttons within 5 minutes, the bot will resume waiting till the task doer sends the rest of the completed task within the time given for the task (if the task doer would have sent the first 30% of the completed task within the time given for the task) or till the task fee reaches zero amount (if the task doer would have sent the first 30% of the task after the time given for the task is up), and if you are confused by saying when did the bot paused waiting and the answer is that the bot will pause waiting as soon as the task doer sends the first 30% of the completed time within the probable times i described earlier. And before i tell you what happens if the task doer sends the rest of the task within the time given for the task (if the task doer would have sent the first 30% of the completed task within the time given for the task) or till the task fee reaches zero amount (if the task doer would have sent the first 30% of the task after the time given for the task is up), i want to tell a couple of other instructions so keep on reading.
 But if the task doer clicks the deny button before the 5 minutes are up, a message (This message has an amharic version)  with two buttons attached below it labeled as “Give a Week” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Report to Taskifii” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task doer letting them know that sometimes it might be network reasons or transaction delay reasons  so if they want to give it a week till the money potentially arrives to their bank account ,  they can click the give a week button , the message will also let them know that if they click the give a week button , they and the task creator [the task creator’s name] won’t be able to use taskifii till they either recieve the taskfee (and notify taskifii that they recieved it) within a week or till the week is up in which taskifii will get to the bottom of this and punish the one who is found guilty , the message will also let them know that if they want the taskifii team to get to the bottom of this as soon as possible, they can click the report to taskifii button, the message will aslo let them know that the taskifii team is a bit busy with other reports like theirs so they shall wait till taskifii studies their case , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this and reaches out to them, the message will also warn them to click one of the buttons below within 5 minutes otherwise taskifii will assume that they recieved the task fee. And a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has denied that they have recieved the task fee so now they (the task creator) must wait to see if the task doer either wishes to wait a week to recieve the task fee or report this case to taskifii. Then if the task doer clicks the give a week button  ,  the give a week button and the report to taskifii button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked , then a message (This message has an amharic version) with two buttons attached below it labeled as “Received” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Report to Taskifii” (This button label has an amharic version) (yes, this button will do the same thing as the one before in which i will tell you later what it does if it gets clicked)   will be sent to the task doer letting them know that they must click the received button if they have received the task fee before the week is up, the message will also let them know that once the week is up and they haven’t clicked the received button , taskifii will study this case and give the right measurement to whomever is found guilty, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they recieve the task fee and click the recieved button within a week or till taskifii studies this case(if they clicked the report to taskifii button ). But i before i continue i want you to know that from earlier if it was a situation where the task doer doesn’t click the give a week button or the report to taskifii button next to it in time (the time i told you earlier) or even now if the task doer clicks the recieved button within a week (i know it’s confusing what i said but since both of these have the same result i decided to tell you what happens if either of the things happen), the buttons(if the task doer didn’t click the give a week button or the report to taskifii button within a week ,  the give a week button and the report to taskifii button is what i mean by buttons here  but if the task doer where in the stage where they clicked the recieved button within a week , the recieved button and the report to taskifii button next to it is what i mean by buttons here) will now stop doing anything if they get clicked , then bot will send a message to the task doer and the task creator letting them know that sadly due to the payment delay and time delay , the contract for the task delegation can’t continue no further , then the bot will also send another message (This message has an amharic version) with 5 buttons (This button label has an amharic version) attached below it (each labeled with star emoji that in which the color inside the star is not yellow but the color of the button meaning this “ ☆”, and the buttons must be arranged in one horizontal line in which every buttons are next to each other) to the task doer and the task creator, the message (This message has an amharic version)  sent to the task doer will congratulate them in their success of finishing and delivering the first 30% of the completed task, the message will also thank them for doing their part and using taskifii, the message will also let them know that taskifii is happy to include  [the task doer’s name] as a trustworthy , responsible and valuable member of Taskifii , the message will also let them know taskifii is sorry any kind of inconvenience, the message will also let them know that they have reached the final stage in which they have to rate the task creator [task creator’s name] from one star to five stars , the message will also let them know that it’s mandatory for them to rate the task creator before gaining access to use taskifii again, the message will also let them  that if they click the first star , it means  their experience with the task Creator was Very poor or unsatisfactory,  but if they click the second star button it means their experience with the task Creator was Poor or below expectations,  but if they click the Third star button it means their experience with the task Creator was Average or met expectations,  but if they click the fourth star button it means their experience with the task Creator was good or exceeded their expectations,  but if they click the 5th start button it means their experience with the task creator was excellent or outstanding, and the message (This message has an amharic version)  sent to the task creator will congratulate them in their success of delegating atleats 30% of the task, the message will also thank them for doing their part, the message will also let them know that taskifii is  happy to include them [the task creator’s name ] as a trustworthy and valuable member of taskifii,  the message will also let them know that they have reached the final stage in which they have to rate the task doer [task doer’s name] from one star to five stars , the message will also let them know that it’s mandatory for them to rate the task doer before gaining access to use taskifii again, the message will also let them that if they click the first star button , it means their experience with the task doer was Very poor or unsatisfactory,  but  if they click the second star button it means their experience with the task doer was Poor or below expectations,  but if they click the Third star button it means their experience with the task doer was Average or met expectations,  but if they click the fourth star button it means their experience with the task doer was good or exceeded their expectations,  but if they click the 5th star button it means their experience with the task doer was excellent or outstanding. Then If the task doer clicks one of the 5 buttons , the color of the inside part of the star in the button clicked will turn to yellow as well as the ones before it (this is ofcourse if there any before it i.e if the user clicks the first star button in the left of the user’s point of view , the only star in a button in which the color  inside of the star will change to yellow will only be the first one that was clicked on because there is nothing before it) , then the buttons will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then a message (This message has an amharic version) will  be sent to the task doer letting them know that they have successfully rated the task creator , the message will also let them know that taskifii hopes they(the task doer) have enjoyed using the taskifii. But if the task creator clicks one of the 5 buttons , the color of the inside part of the star in the button clicked will turn to yellow as well as the ones before it (this is ofcourse if there any i.e if the user clicks the first star button in the left of the user’s point of view , the only star in a button in which the color  inside of the star will change to yellow will only be the first one that was clicked on because there is nothing before it), then the buttons will stop doing anything if they get clicked,  a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that they have successfully rated the task doer , the message will also let them know that taskifii hopes they(the task creator) have enjoyed using the taskifii. But if the task doer would have clicked the report to taskifii button (either one i.e if the task doer clicked the report to taskifii button within 5 minutes rather than clicking the give a week button next to it within 5 minutes or if the task doer would have clicked the report to taskifii button within a week rather than clicking the recieved button next to it within a week ) or if the task doer would have not clicked the recieved button or the report to taskifii button next to it within a week , the buttons (if the task doer would have clicked the report to taskifii button next to the give a week button within the 5 minutes , the give a week button and the report to taskifii button is what i mean by buttons here  but if the task doer where in the stage where they clicked the report to taskifii button next to the received button within a week , the recieved button and the report to taskifii button next to it is what i mean by buttons here)will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then  a message (This message has an amharic version)  will be sent  to the task doer letting them know that  taskifii has been notified about the report so they must wait till  taskifii studies this case and gets back to them(the task doers)  in which they(the task doer) can’t use taskifii till then . A message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has reported to taskifii that the task creator( in the message it will say “you”) did not send the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they shall wait till taskifii studies this case and gets back to them  in which they(the task creator) can’t use taskifii till then. Then the bot will ban the task doer and the task creator from using the bot as well as the group(the group i told you about earlier). Then the Task post without the apply button, the related file(if the task creator gave a related file) , the completed task the task doer sent, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the  task creator’s phone number with emphasis, and the receipt the task creator sent will all be sent to another private channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has  Five buttons attached below it labeled as “Contact Task Doer” , “Contact Task Creator”, “keep blocking task doer”, “keep blocking task creator”, and “Completed” . And the giant message will have two hashtags in it saying “#UnPaid” and “#UnCompleted” .  And if the contact task doer  button is clicked ,  it will take the user that clicked it, to the bot ,  and then  a message  will be sent to the user  through the bot  letting them know  that they should write a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then  if the user gives a message  or anything else,  it will be sent to the task doer.  But if the user clicks the contact task Creator button,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then a message will be sent to the user through the bot letting them know that they should write a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or anything else,  it would be sent to the task creator . 
 But  if the keep blocking task doer  button was clicked  by a user,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user  letting them know  that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task doer.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task doer later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task doer (i will explain how next) . Then  the bot  will send to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month” . And  then  if the user clicks  the day button , the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 days).  But if the user clicked the month button,  the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of months they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning  the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task doer is banned/kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task doer will then get 5 one-star reviews as if  5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task creator, the task creator  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator five-star reviews. Then in the giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task doer” (written in red color).  But if a user clicks the unblock task doer button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task doer . Then the bot will unban the task doer from the bot as well as the group.  But if a user clicked the keep blocking task creator button , it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task creator.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task creator later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task creator (i will explain how next). Then  the bot  will send  to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month”.  And then if the user clicks the day button , the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to keep on banning the task creator. Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 days). Then if the user gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier, then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task creator is kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task creator will then get 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task doer, the task doer  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-star reviews. Then in the then giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task creator” (written in Blue color). But if a user clicks the unblock task creator button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task creator . Then the bot will unban the task creator from the bot as well as the group. Okay but if the completed button is clicked , it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. I also want you to know that if the giant message will then have the text “The guilty is the task creator” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task creator button) and for the second time in the future, if the task creator gets the report to taskifii button clicked by a task doer on a task they posted , the then giant message will  have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task creator”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task creator again” , then the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task doer [half the task fee they(the task creator) planned to pay the first victim task doer] birr and till they pay the second victimized task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) were supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr , the message will also include both of the task doer’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doers, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task doer) letting them know that taskifii has found the task creator guilty so the task creator [task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii  . And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task doer a message letting them know that a previous task creator they have worked with in the past by the name [task creator’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task creator) did to them (the task doer) in the past to another task doer , the message will also let them know that because the task creator repeated their mistake again , the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they pay half of the task fee they were supposed to pay them (the task doer) to them (the task doer) plus another corresponding task fee to the other task doer, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task creator sends the monetary punishment they (the task doer) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task creator to only click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task doer, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they send as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that they must now send the receipt of payment for the second victimized task doer. Then if the task creator gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will exactly wait till the first victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task doer the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version), and the message will let them know that a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name] has finally sent the punishment fee of [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the first victimized task doer] birr to them(the first victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will also wait exactly till the second victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then bot will send to the second victimized task doer the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “ I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task creator was supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr to them(the second victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will ban(or keep on banning) the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s telegram username, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to first victimized task doer], the task creator’s telegram username, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#FVTD” ,and “#unpaid2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button (which i will explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (first victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews each as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task doer would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task doer clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (and obviously fyi ,this sent button will appear  if the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens with more details , for now just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message(This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because both the task doers have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. Then also the bot will give the task creator 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews and the bot will also give both the task doer 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creator gave the task doer five-stars.And btw ,I forgot to tell you that ,as soon as the first victimized task doer or the second victimized task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task doer would have clicked the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task doer  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then the second receipt , the second victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s telegram username,  the second victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis ,the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to second victimized task doer] birr,  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#SVTD” ,and “#unpaid2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button  is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doers five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii.

Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task creator again” text in it  and  for the third time or more in the future, if the task creator gets the report to taskifii button clicked by a task doer on a task they posted , then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttc”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task creator is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttc button , the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e making the task doer fix a mistake outside of the task description) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) was going to pay by the task doer] birr , the message will also include the task doer’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that after taskifii studied the case , the task creator has been found guilty so the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer). And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task creator to click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task creator) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt .

Okay going back now, I also want you to know that if the giant message would have had the text “The guilty is the task doer” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task doer button) and next time if the task doer gets in the situation like this for the for the second time in the future (i.e in the future for the second time, if the task doer clicks the report to taskifii button for another task)   , the then giant message  sent will have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task doer”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task doer again”,  then the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first or the former victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr and till they pay the second or the current victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task creator) letting them know that taskifii has found the task doer guilty so the task doer [task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee/ monetary punishment fee to them(the task creators), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii. And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task creator a message letting them know that a previous task doer they have worked with in the past by the name [task doer’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task doer) did to them (the task creator) in the past to another task creator(a.k.a the second victimized task creator) , the message will also let them know that because the task doer repeated their mistake again , the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half of the task fee they were supposed to get paid by  them (the task creator)initially  to them (the task creator) plus another corresponding monetary punishment fee to the other task creator, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task doer sends the monetary punishment fee they (the task creator) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt .

Then also when the second victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,  bot will send to the second victimized task creator the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator] birr to them(the second victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t, they must click the i deny button.

The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#FVTC” ,and “#unpaid2”.

But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (this is ofcourse if the second victimized task creator clicked the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens, just know there is a sent button involved in it ) (btw the same goes vice versa i.e if a user clicked the sent button or if the second victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the first victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that because both the task creators have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the first victimized task creator or the second victimized task creator clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button,both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task creator  will be unbanned from the bot and the group, then  the second receipt , the second victimized task creator’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis ,the second victimized task creator’s telegram username ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee of the task the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator],  task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#SVTC” ,and “#unpaid2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars each . Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task doer again” text in it  and if the task doer gets in the situation like this  for the third time or more in the future (i.e in the future for the third time or more, if they click the report to taskifii button for another task), then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttd”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task doer is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttd button , the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has found them guilty by a situation(i.e for lying by saying i didn’t recieve the task fee) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the task creator] birr , the message will also include  task creator’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that after taskifii studied the case ,the task doer has been found guilty so the task doer  has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creator). And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task doer) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), when the task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , the bot will send to the task creator the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator] birr to them (the task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task creator’s name with emphasis ,the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#TC” ,and “#unpaid3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because  the task creator have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task creator  clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed.
 And if the task doer would have clicked the non-agreed upon button before the time to click the non-agreed upon button was up, a message with a button attached below it labeled as “Cancel this report” will be sent to the task doer letting them know that they should send a message that explains at least one thing that is a non agreed upon work outside of the task description that the task creator insisted them(the task doer) to fix in the completed task/30% of it , the message will also let them know that they got 5 minutes to send the message or they won’t get another chance to report this. Then if the task doer doesn’t send a message within 5 minutes or if the task doer clicks the cancel this report button within 5 minutes   , the cancel this report button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked , then the bot will wait till the task doer sends the updated and completed task before the revision time is up, in which if they do or not , the exact same thing or process will happen as i told earlier (i.e the process  i told you of what happens if the task doer sends the updated and completed task before the revision time is up rather than clicking the non agreed upon button ).  But if the task doer would have sent a message or something to the bot within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button ,  the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has claimed that the task creator (in the message it will say “you”) is insisting them(the task doer) to fix something that is a non agreed upon extra work outside of the task description,  the message will also let them know that taskifii will get to the bottom of this and punish the one who is found guilty, the message will also let the task creator know that the taskifii team has a lot complaints like this to resolve so it might take a while till taskifii studies this case , the message will also let them know that they (the task creator) can’t unfortunately use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this.  And also from the task doer side a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent letting them know that they have successfully sent the report claim to taskifii, the message will also let them know that they shall wait till taskifii team studies this case and gets to the bottom of it , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this. Then both the task doer and the task creator will be banned from using both the group and this bot until i can study this case and confirm the one who is guilty and the way this happens is once the task doer gives a message or anything within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button , the message or something the task creator sent within first 15% of the revision time after clicking the fix button , the message the task doer sent within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button , the related file (if there is any), the task post without the apply button, the task doer’s name with emphasis ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, and the  task creator’s phone number with emphasis will all be sent to another channel (which has the chat id :--1002432632907) as one giant message(which will have two hashtags in it saying “#nonagreedupon” and “#UnCompleted”) with seven buttons  attached below it labeled as “Contact Task Doer” , “Contact Task Creator”, “ keep blocking task doer”, “keep blocking task creator”, “Unblock task doer”, “Unblock Task creator” and “Completed” .  And if the contact task doer  button is clicked ,  it will take the user that clicked it, to the bot ,  and then  a message  will be sent to the user  through the bot  letting them know  that they should write a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then  if the user gives a message  or anything else,  it will be sent to the task doer.  But if the user clicks the contact task Creator button,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then a message will be sent to the user through the bot letting them know that they should write a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or anything else,  it would be sent to the task creator . 
 But  if the keep blocking task doer  button was clicked  by a user,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user  letting them know  that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task doer.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task doer later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task doer (i will explain how next) . Then  the bot  will send to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month” . And  then  if the user clicks  the day button , the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 days).  But if the user clicked the month button,  the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of months they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning  the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task doer is banned/kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task doer will then get 5 one-star reviews as if  5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task creator, the task creator  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator five-star reviews. Then in the giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task doer” (written in red color).  But if a user clicks the unblock task doer button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task doer . Then the bot will unban the task doer from the bot as well as the group.  But if a user clicked the keep blocking task creator button , it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task creator.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task creator later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task creator (i will explain how next). Then  the bot  will send  to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month”.  And then if the user clicks the day button , the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to keep on banning the task creator. Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 days). Then if the user gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier, then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task creator is kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task creator will then get 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task doer, the task doer  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-star reviews. Then in the then giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task creator” (written in Blue color). But if a user clicks the unblock task creator button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task creator . Then the bot will unban the task creator from the bot as well as the group. Okay but if the completed button is clicked , it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. I also want you to know that if the giant message will then have the text “The guilty is the task creator” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task creator button) and for the second time ,if the task creator gets a non agreed upon report from a task doer in the future (i.e if task doer sends a message within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button) , the giant message will then have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task creator”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task creator again” , then the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task doer [half the task fee they(the task creator) planned to pay the first victim task doer] birr and till they pay the second victimized task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) were supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr , the message will also include both of the task doer’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doers, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task doer will be un banned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task doer) letting them know that taskifii has found the task creator guilty so the task creator [task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii  . And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task doer a message letting them know that a previous task creator they have worked with in the past by the name [task creator’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task creator) did to them (the task doer) in the past to another task doer , the message will also let them know that because the task creator repeated their mistake again , the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they pay half of the task fee they were supposed to pay them (the task doer) to them (the task doer) plus another corresponding task fee to the other task doer, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task creator sends the monetary punishment they (the task doer) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task creator to only click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task doer, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they send as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that they must now send the receipt of payment for the second victimized task doer. Then if the task creator gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will exactly wait till the first victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task doer the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version), and the message will let them know that a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name] has finally sent the punishment fee of [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the first victimized task doer] birr to them(the first victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will also wait exactly till the second victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then bot will send to the second victimized task doer the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “ I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task creator was supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr to them(the second victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will ban(or keep on banning) the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s telegram username, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to first victimized task doer], the task creator’s telegram username, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#FVTD” ,and “#nonagreedupon2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button (which i will explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (first victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews each as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task doer would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task doer clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (and obviously fyi ,this sent button will appear  if the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens with more details , for now just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message(This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because both the task doers have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. Then also the bot will give the task creator 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews and the bot will also give both the task doer 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creator gave the task doer five-stars.And btw ,I forgot to tell you that ,as soon as the first victimized task doer or the second victimized task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task doer would have clicked the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task doer  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then the second receipt , the second victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s telegram username,  the second victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis ,the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to second victimized task doer] birr,  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#SVTD” ,and “#nonagreedupon2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button  is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doers five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task creator again” text in it  and for the third time or more ,if the task creator gets a non agreed upon report from a task doer in the future (i.e for the third time or more in the future , if a task doer sends a message within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button for a task), then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttc”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task creator is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttc button , the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e trying to make the task doer fix a mistake that wasn’t theirs) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) was going to pay by the task doer] birr , the message will also include the task doer’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that after taskifii studied the case , the task creator has been found guilty so the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer). And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task creator to click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task creator) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), the bot will exactly wait till the task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,then the bot will send to the task doer the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the task doer] birr to them (the task doer), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task doer’s name with emphasis ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the task creator’s name with emphasis, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task creator’s email address with emphasis, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#TD” ,and “#nonagreedupon3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because  the task doer have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then also the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 



Okay going back now, I also want you to know that if the giant message would have had the text “The guilty is the task doer” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task doer button) and for the second time  ,if the task doer gives a non agreed upon report in in the future (i.e for the second time in the future , if the task doer sends a message within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button) , the then giant message  sent will have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task doer”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task doer again”,  then the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first or the former victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr and till they pay the second or the current victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task creator) letting them know that taskifii has found the task doer guilty so the task doer [task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee/ monetary punishment fee to them(the task creators), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii. And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task creator a message letting them know that a previous task doer they have worked with in the past by the name [task doer’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task doer) did to them (the task creator) in the past to another task creator(a.k.a the second victimized task creator) , the message will also let them know that because the task doer repeated their mistake again , the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half of the task fee they were supposed to get paid by  them (the task creator)initially  to them (the task creator) plus another corresponding monetary punishment fee to the other task creator, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task doer sends the monetary punishment fee they (the task creator) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that they must give the receipt of payment for the second victimized task creator . Then if the task doer gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will wait exactly till the first victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task creator the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr to them(the first victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then also when the second victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,  bot will send to the second victimized task creator the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator] birr to them(the second victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t, they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task creator’s name with emphasis ,the first victimized task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the first victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr,  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”.

Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because  the task creator have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task creator  clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed.  And if the task doer clicks the non agreed upon button and doesn’t send a message within 5 minutes after clicking it  or if the task doer clicks the cancel this report button within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button , as i told you before the non agreed upon button will then after stop doing anything if it gets clicked ,then the bot will still wait till the task doer sends the updated and completed task within revision time in which if they do , the same thing will happen as before. 

 

 Okay now moving on, i forgot to tell you that If the task Doer would have sent the first 30% of the completed task within the time given to finish and submit the completed task a.k.a time given for the task,  firstly the  violation button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked(if the completed task was sent before the time to click the violation button was up),  then the same thing would happen as if the task doer would have sent the completed task / 30% of it after the time given for the task was up but before the task fee reached zero (in which i explain somewhere in this instructions before).  
 And btw i forgot to tell you that if the task doer wouldn’t have sent the completed task at all,  even within the time given for the task or even after that (i.e till task fee reaches zero) or if the task doer wouldn’t have sent  the updated and completed  task within 30% of the the revision time , a message will be sent to the task doer letting them know that they have been banned from taskifii for 5 months for not meeting their obligations, the message will also let them know that if they repeat this action again , there will be some monetary punishment to pay. Then the bot will ban the task doer from the bot and the group for 5 months. Then after the 5 months are up (i.e after the task doer is no longer banned from the bot and the group), the Bot will send a message to the task doer letting them know that they can now start using taskifii ,  the message will also let them know that they should be careful in not repeating this action again otherwise next time there would be monetary punishments to pay. If the task doer repeats this mistake for the second time again i.e not send the completed task at all (i.e if they don’t send the completed task neither within the time given for the task nor after that ,till task fee reaches zero),  the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victim task creator] birr and till they pay the second victim task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victim task creator and the second task creator letting them know that the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creators). And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that they must give the receipt of payment for the second victimized task creator . Then if the task doer gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) and when the first victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , the bot will send to the first victimized task creator the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr to them(the first victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then also when the second victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,  bot will send to the second victimized task creator the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator] birr to them(the second victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t, they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task creator’s name with emphasis ,the first victimized task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the first victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator],  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#FVTC” ,and “#undelivered2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the first victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( first victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars.

But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (this is ofcourse if the second victimized task creator clicked the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens, just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because both the task creators have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the first victimized task creator or the second victimized task creator clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task creator  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then  the second receipt , the second victimized task creator’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis ,the second victimized task creator’s telegram username ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee of the task the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator],  task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#SVTC” ,and “#undelivered2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions.

If the task doer repeats this mistake ( i.e not send the completed task at all (i.e if they don’t send the completed task neither within the time given for the task nor after that ,till task fee reaches zero) ) for the third time or more, the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has completed studying the case and taskifii has found them guilty by a situation like this for the third time or more (i.e not sending the completed task at all ( neither within the time given for the task nor after that ,till task fee reaches zero) for the third time or more ) so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the task creator] birr , the message will also include  task creator’s name(with emphasis) and all their (the task creator’s) banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creator).

 And before i tell you what happens if the task doer sends the middle 40% of the completed task in time (if the task doer would have sent the first 30% of the completed task within the time given for the task ), i will first tell you What happens if the task Doer doesn’t send the middle 40% of the completed task within the time given to  complete and submit the task(if the task doer would have sent the first 30% of the completed task within the time given for the task ). But before i tell you it , i want you to know that the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer every 20% of the remaining time till time given for the task is up, and the message will let the task doer know that they got [the remaining till the time given for the task is up] to submit the middle 40% of the completed task to the bot so that they must send the middle 40% of the task quickly. But the bot will only keep on sending this message to the task doer till either  the task doer sends the completed task /the middle 40% of it to the bot within the time given for the task or till the time given for the task is up .   Okay moving on, If the task doer doesn’t send the completed task/the middle 40% of the completed task within the time given for the task , an alertful message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task doer every 20% of the remaining time til the task fee reaches zero amount (sorry for confusing you, the reason why task fee will reach zero amount is because the birr amount deducted per hour from the task fee(the task creator would have given this earlier in task inquiry format) will start being deducted from the task fee every hour once the task doer missed the chance to send the completed/the middle 40% of it within the time given to do the task) and the messages will be kept on being sent to the task doer til either the task doer sends the completed task /the middle 40 % of it within the remaining time till task fee reaches zero amount or till the task fee reaches zero, the message will warn them that they were late to submit the completed task so starting from the current time  [birr amount deducted  per hour from task fee] birr  (the task creator gave this  earlier in the task inquiry format) will be deducted from their task fee till either the task fee reaches zero birr amount or til they send the middle 40% of the completed task before the task fee amount reaches zero amount, the message will also let them know that if the task fee reaches zero amount before they submit the middle 40% of the completed task to the bot, they will be banned from using taskifii for 5 months and if they repeat this mistake again, there would be a monetary punishment to use taskifii again i.e they will pay half the task fee to the former victim task creator and the new victim task creator, the message  will also let them know that they got [the remaining time til the task fee reaches zero] to submit the task . 
And also an alertful message (This message has an amharic version)  will be sent to the task creator every 20% of the remaining time til the task fee reaches zero amount (the reason why it will reach zero amount is because the birr amount deducted per hour from the task fee (the task creator would have given this earlier) will start being deducted from the task fee every hour once the task doer missed the chance to send the completed task  with in the time given to do the task and til either the task doer sends the completed task within the remaining time till task fee reaches zero amount or till the task fee reaches zero amount) , and the message let’s them know that the task doer hasn’t  delivered the completed task within the time given for the task , the message will also let them know that  [ the birr amount deducted per hour from task fee] birr will be deducted from the task fee every hour till either the task fee reaches zero amount or til the task doer sends the middle 40% of the completed task before the task fee reaches zero amount. 
Okay then if the task doer sends the middle 40% of the completed task before the task fee reaches zero amount , firstly the bot will pause the time till task fee reaches zero amount(i will tell you when it will resume) ,then the middle 40% of the completed task the task doer sent  would be sent to the task creator with a message (This message has an amharic version) attached  below it  and the message will have two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Fix” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Continue” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that the task doer has sent this 40 % of the completed task to them,  the message will also let them know that they must check for any errors or mistakes  made by the task doer,  the message will also let them  that if they find  an   error or mistake  made by the task Doer ,they(the task creator) can notify and make the task Doer  fix whatever the error or mistake they(the task doer) made,  the message will also let them know that they got [the 20% of the revision Time] (the task doer gave earlier in the task inquiry) to click the fix button and give a message that will be sent to the task doer to fix any mistakes they might have made ,  the message will also let them know that  the  task doer  will fix the mistakes  and send the updated  completed task within [the remaining time til 40 % of the revision time is up ], the  message will also let them know that if they click  the  continue button  it means that there is no error or mistake in the completed task the task doer sent ,  the message will also let them know that if they click the continue button,  it means  that they they want to move on ,  the message will also let them know  that if they don't click the fix button or the continue button within [the 20% of the revision time] , it's going to be taken as the middle 40% of the completed task sent has no error or mistakes in it.  And also while this message is being sent to task creator, another message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task doer  letting them know that they have successfully sent the middle 40 % of the completed task,  the message will also let them know that the task Creator is reviewing and checking for any kind of errors or mistakes they(the task doer) might have made,  the message will also let them know that the task creator has [the 20% of the revision time] to notify them(the task doers) about any kind of errors or mistakes they(the task doers) might have made so that they (task doers)can quickly fix them and send the updated ,correct and  completed task here (to the bot), the message will also let the task doer know that they must  wait attentively for at most [the 20% of the revision time] til/ if the task creator notifies about a potential mistake or error they (the task doer) must fix so that they(the task doer) can use their remaining time effectively til the time given to send the updated and completed task is up  . Then after both this messages is sent to the receivers  , and then  if the task creator clicks the fix button  before the 20% of the revision time has passed, a message (This message has an amharic version)  with a button attached below it labeled as “Accidental Request” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator letting them know that they should write  one message letting the task doer know every mistakes & errors they(the task doer) must fix, the message will also let them know that they must make everything clear for the task doer to understand , the message will also let them know that they got [the remaining time til the 20% of the revision time is up] to send the message here(to the bot), the message will also let them know that if they click the accidental request button, it means they changed their minds to understanding that the 40 % of the completed task doesn’t have any errors or mistakes. Before i continue , i forgot to tell you that a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator every 20 % of the 20% of the revision time  till they either click the fix button or the continue button , and the message let’s them know how much time they got to click the fix button and notify the task doer any errors or mistakes to fix if there is any,  the message will also let them know that if they click the continue button before [the remaining time til the 20% of the revision time is up] or if they don’t click any of the two buttons  within  [the remaining time till the 20% of the  revision time is up],  it means that  there's no error or mistake  with the completed task the task doer has sent . Moving on,  as i told you earlier , if the task creator clicks the fix button, firstly the fix button and the continue button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, and then  a message (This message has an amharic version)  with the button attached below it  labeled as  “Accidental Request”  (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator, and i also told you what the message states but i forgot to tell you that after the task creator clicks the fix button , the bot will also send a separate message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator   every 20% of the remaining time till the 20% of the revision time is up letting them know that they got [remaining time til the 20% of the revision time is up] to send the message that notifies the task doer what mistakes or errors to fix; But also  the bot will only keep on sending this messages till either the 20% of the revision time is up or till the task creator sends something(anything) to the bot before the 20% of the revision time is up. Moving on, if the task creator clicks the fix button and  then sends a message or anything else that notifies the task Doer the mistakes they should fix within the time i stated earlier, the message or whatever the task creator sent plus a separate message (This message has an amharic version)  with a button attached below it labeled as “Non-Agreed upon” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent  to the task doer, and if it is a message the task creator sent, then it will be sent to the task doer in quotations letting the task doer know the task creator sent this message and the separate message sent to the task doer will let them(the task doer) know that the task creator wants them(the task doers) to fix the mistakes described above that they(the task doer) might have made , the separate message will also let them know that they got [ the remaining time til the  40% of the  revision time is up] to submit the corrected and finalized task, the separate message will also let them know that if the task creator is trying to make them(the task doers) fix a mistake or error that they (the task doer) didn’t make i.e anything not described in the task description, they can click the non-agreed upon button below , the separate message will also let them know that if they plan to click the non-agreed upon button , they must click it within [the first 15% of the remaining time till 40 % of the revision time is up], the separate message will also let them know that they must be sure before clicking the non agreed upon because if they are wrong , there will be consequences. A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the notification  is successfully sent to the task doer. Then if the task doer doesn’t click the non-agreed upon button within the first 15% of the remaining time till the  40 % of the revision time is up or if the task doer sends the updated and completed task within the first 15% of the remaining time till the 40% of the revision time is up , the non-agreed upon button will stop doing anything .Then  if the task doer sends to the bot the updated and the completed task before 40 % of the revision time is up , the updated and the completed task  and a separate message (This message has an amharic version)  below it that has two button below it labeled as “Not Fixed” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Fixed” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator , the message lets the task creator know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has sent the updated and the completed task above, the message also lets them know that if everything is fixed in the updated and the completed task, they can click the Fixed button below, but if something is not fixed in the  the updated and the completed task , they can click the Not Fixed button below, the message will also let them know that they must click one of the two buttons below within 20 minutes or taskifii will take it as if  they(the task creator) clicked the fix button. And also a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator every 5 minutes for 20 minutes or until the task creator clicks either button before the 20 minutes  letting them know how much time they got to click any of the two buttons till their 20 minutes are up .  Then if the task creator clicks the Fixed button within 20 minutes or if the task creator doesn’t click any of the two buttons within 20 minutes , same thing will happen as if the continue button was clicked(read the whole instructions to understand) i.e the fixed button and the continue button have the same function when clicked(the only difference they have is their button label, and also as you will see, when the continue button is clicked, the continue button and the fix button will then stop doing anything if they get clicked, but in this case , the fixed button and the not fixed button are the ones that will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, but all the rest of the things are the same) . But if the task creator clicks the not fixed button , the fixed button and the not fixed button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked , then a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator letting them know that this case will be studied by taskifii, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii reaches out to them. A message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that the task creator has claimed that something was not fixed in the updated and the completed task ,  the  message will also let them know that this case will be studied by taskifii, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii reaches out to them.  Then both the task doer and the task creator will be banned from using the bot and the group.  Then the Task post without the apply button, the related file(if the task creator gave a related file) , the middle 40% of the completed task the task doer sent first, the updated and completed task the task doer sent(the middle 40% of it) , the notification message (or something else) the task creator sent that let the task doer know what errors or mistakes to fix,  the task doer’s name with emphasis ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the  task creator’s phone number with emphasis, and the task creator’s name with emphasis will all be sent to another private channel that has a chat id of “-1002432632907” as one giant message that has  Five buttons attached below it labeled as “Contact Task Doer” , “Contact Task Creator”, “ keep blocking task doer”, “keep blocking task creator”, and “Completed” . And the giant message will have two hashtags in it saying “#Mistake” and “#UnCompleted”  .And if the contact task doer  button is clicked ,  it will take the user that clicked it, to the bot ,  and then  a message  will be sent to the user  through the bot  letting them know  that they should write a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then  if the user gives a message  or anything else,  it will be sent to the task doer.  But if the user clicks the contact task Creator button,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then a message will be sent to the user through the bot letting them know that they should write a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or anything else,  it would be sent to the task creator . 
 But  if the keep blocking task doer  button was clicked  by a user,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user  letting them know  that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task doer.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task doer later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task doer (i will explain how next) . Then  the bot  will send to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month” . And  then  if the user clicks  the day button , the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 days).  But if the user clicked the month button,  the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of months they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning  the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task doer is banned/kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task doer will then get 5 one-star reviews as if  5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task creator, the task creator  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator five-star reviews. Then in the giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task doer” (written in red color).  But if a user clicks the unblock task doer button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task doer . Then the bot will unban the task doer from the bot as well as the group.  But if a user clicked the keep blocking task creator button , it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task creator.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task creator later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task creator (i will explain how next). Then  the bot  will send  to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month”.  And then if the user clicks the day button , the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to keep on banning the task creator. Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 days). Then if the user gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier, then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task creator is kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task creator will then get 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task doer, the task doer  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-star reviews. Then in the then giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task creator” (written in Blue color). But if a user clicks the unblock task creator button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task creator . Then the bot will unban the task creator from the bot as well as the group. Okay but if the completed button is clicked , it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. I also want you to know that if the giant message will then have the text “The guilty is the task creator” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task creator button) and next time if the task creator clicks the not fixed button for another task for the for the second time  , the then giant message will  have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task creator”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task creator again” , then the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task doer [half the task fee they(the task creator) planned to pay the first victim task doer] birr and till they pay the second victimized task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) were supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr , the message will also include both of the task doer’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doers, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task doer) letting them know that taskifii has found the task creator guilty so the task creator [task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii  . And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task doer a message letting them know that a previous task creator they have worked with in the past by the name [task creator’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task creator) did to them (the task doer) in the past to another task doer , the message will also let them know that because the task creator repeated their mistake again , the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they pay half of the task fee they were supposed to pay them (the task doer) to them (the task doer) plus another corresponding task fee to the other task doer, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task creator sends the monetary punishment they (the task doer) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task creator to only click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task doer, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they send as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that they must now send the receipt of payment for the second victimized task doer. Then if the task creator gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will exactly wait till the first victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task doer the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version), and the message will let them know that a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name] has finally sent the punishment fee of [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the first victimized task doer] birr to them(the first victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will also wait exactly till the second victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then bot will send to the second victimized task doer the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “ I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task creator was supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr to them(the second victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will ban(or keep on banning) the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s telegram username, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to first victimized task doer], the task creator’s telegram username, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#FVTD” ,and “#mistake2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button (which i will explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (first victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews each as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task doer would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task doer clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (and obviously fyi ,this sent button will appear  if the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens with more details , for now just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message(This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because both the task doers have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. Then also the bot will give the task creator 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews and the bot will also give both the task doer 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creator gave the task doer five-stars.And btw ,I forgot to tell you that ,as soon as the first victimized task doer or the second victimized task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task doer would have clicked the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task doer  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then the second receipt , the second victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s telegram username,  the second victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis ,the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to second victimized task doer] birr,  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#SVTD” ,and “#mistake2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button  is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doers five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task creator again” text in it  and if the task creator clicks the not fixed button for another task for the third time or more in the future , then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttc”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task creator is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttc button , the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e trying to make the task doer fix a mistake outside of the task description) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) was going to pay by the task doer] birr , the message will also include the task doer’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that after taskifii studied the case , the task creator has been found guilty so the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer). And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task creator to click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task creator) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), the bot will exactly wait till the task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,then the bot will send to the task doer the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the task doer] birr to them (the task doer), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task doer’s name with emphasis ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the task creator’s name with emphasis, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task creator’s email address with emphasis, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#TD” ,and “#mistake3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions.  And as i told you before, the task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because  the task doer have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then also the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 



Okay going back now, I also want you to know that if the giant message would have had the text “The guilty is the task doer” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task doer button) and next time if the task doer gets in the situation like this for the for the second time in the future (i.e in the future for the second time, if a task creator clicks the not fixed button for a task  the task doer worked on/ was working on)   , the then giant message  sent will have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task doer”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task doer again”,  then the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first or the former victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr and till they pay the second or the current victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task creator) letting them know that taskifii has found the task doer guilty so the task doer [task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee/ monetary punishment fee to them(the task creators), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii. And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task creator a message letting them know that a previous task doer they have worked with in the past by the name [task doer’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task doer) did to them (the task creator) in the past to another task creator(a.k.a the second victimized task creator) , the message will also let them know that because the task doer repeated their mistake again , the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half of the task fee they were supposed to get paid by  them (the task creator)initially  to them (the task creator) plus another corresponding monetary punishment fee to the other task creator, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task doer sends the monetary punishment fee they (the task creator) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that they must give the receipt of payment for the second victimized task creator . Then if the task doer gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will wait exactly till the first victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task creator the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr to them(the first victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then also when the second victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,  bot will send to the second victimized task creator the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator] birr to them(the second victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t, they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task creator’s name with emphasis ,the first victimized task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the first victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr,  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#FVTC” ,and “#mistake2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the first victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions.

Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist),  the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year.

Then after all of this are sent to the task creator,  if the task creator sends something to the bot within 40  minutes,  whatever the task Creator sent to the bot  will be  sent to the task doer  with a message (This message has an amharic version)  and two buttons  attached below the message  labeled as “Approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Deny” (This button label has an amharic version),  the message  will let the task doer know that  the task creator has  claimed  that they ( the task creator)have sent  the task fee to  them (the task doer) ,  the message will also let them know that the task creator has sent  this file(whatever the task creator sent as a receipt)  as a proof that they have paid the task fee to them( the task  doer) ,  the message will also let them know that they must check if they have received the task fee  from the task creator  in which if they did , they can click the approve button below  but if they didn't receive any kind of task fee from the task creator,  they can click the deny button below, the message will also let them know that they got 5 minutes to click one of the buttons below otherwise taskifii will automatically assume that they (the task doer) have recieved the task fee so they must be quick to give an answer in 5 minutes, the message will also let them know that [the total birr amount deducted from the task fee before the task doer sent the completed task ] birr has been deducted from the task fee of [task fee] so they will get paid  [total birr amount deducted from the task fee before the task doer sent the completed task subtracted from the task fee] birr!. A message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the reciept has been successfully sent to the task doer , the message will also let them know that they must wait at most 5 minutes till the task doer confirms that they(the task doer) recieved the task fee.  And if the task doer clicks the approve button within the 5 minutes or if the task doer doesn’t click any of the two buttons within the 5 minutes, the bot will resume waiting till the task doer sends the the final 30% of the completed  task within the time given for the task (if the task doer would have sent the middle 40% of the completed task within the time given for the task) or till the task fee reaches zero amount (if the task doer would have sent the middle 40% of the task after the time given for the task is up), and if you are confused by saying when did the bot paused waiting and the answer is that the bot will pause waiting as soon as the task doer sends the middle 40% of the completed task  within the probable times i described earlier. And before i tell you what happens if the task doer sends the the final 30% of the completed task within the time given for the task (if the task doer would have sent the middle 40% of the completed task within the time given for the task) or till the task fee reaches zero amount (if the task doer would have sent the middle 40% of the task after the time given for the task is up), i want to tell a couple of other instructions so keep on reading.
 But if the task doer clicks the deny button before the 5 minutes are up, a message (This message has an amharic version)  with two buttons attached below it labeled as “Give a Week” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Report to Taskifii” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task doer letting them know that sometimes it might be network reasons or transaction delay reasons  so if they want to give it a week till the money potentially arrives to their bank account ,  they can click the give a week button , the message will also let them know that if they click the give a week button , they and the task creator [the task creator’s name] won’t be able to use taskifii till they either recieve the taskfee (and notify taskifii that they recieved it) within a week or till the week is up in which taskifii will get to the bottom of this and punish the one who is found guilty , the message will also let them know that if they want the taskifii team to get to the bottom of this as soon as possible, they can click the report to taskifii button, the message will aslo let them know that the taskifii team is a bit busy with other reports like theirs so they shall wait till taskifii studies their case , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this and reaches out to them, the message will also warn them to click one of the buttons below within 5 minutes otherwise taskifii will assume that they recieved the task fee. And a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has denied that they have recieved the task fee so now they (the task creator) must wait to see if the task doer either wishes to wait a week to recieve the task fee or report this case to taskifii. Then if the task doer clicks the give a week button  ,  the give a week button and the report to taskifii button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked , then a message (This message has an amharic version) with two buttons attached below it labeled as “Received” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Report to Taskifii” (This button label has an amharic version) (yes, this button will do the same thing as the one before in which i will tell you later what it does if it gets clicked)   will be sent to the task doer letting them know that they must click the received button if they have received the task fee before the week is up, the message will also let them know that once the week is up and they haven’t clicked the received button , taskifii will study this case and give the right measurement to whomever is found guilty, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they recieve the task fee and click the recieved button within a week or till taskifii studies this case(if they clicked the report to taskifii button ). But  before i continue i want you to know that from earlier if it was a situation where the task doer doesn’t click the give a week button or the report to taskifii button next to it in time (the time i told you earlier) or even now if the task doer clicks the recieved button within a week (i know it’s confusing what i said but since both of these have the same result i decided to tell you what happens if either of the things happen), the buttons(if the task doer didn’t click the give a week button or the report to taskifii button within a week ,  the give a week button and the report to taskifii button is what i mean by buttons here  but if the task doer where in the stage where they clicked the recieved button within a week , the recieved button and the report to taskifii button next to it is what i mean by buttons here) will now stop doing anything if they get clicked , then bot will send a message to the task doer and the task creator letting them know that sadly due to the payment delay and time delay , the contract for the task delegation can’t continue no further , then the bot will also send another message (This message has an amharic version) with 5 buttons (This button label has an amharic version) attached below it (each labeled with star emoji that in which the color inside the star is not yellow but the color of the button meaning this “ ☆”, and the buttons must be arranged in one horizontal line in which every buttons are next to each other) to the task doer and the task creator, the message (This message has an amharic version)  sent to the task doer will congratulate them in their success of finishing and delivering the middle 40% of the completed task, the message will also thank them for doing their part and using taskifii, the message will also let them know that taskifii is happy to include  [the task doer’s name] as a trustworthy , responsible and valuable member of Taskifii , the message will also let them know taskifii is sorry any kind of inconvenience, the message will also let them know that they have reached the final stage in which they have to rate the task creator [task creator’s name] from one star to five stars , the message will also let them know that it’s mandatory for them to rate the task creator before gaining access to use taskifii again, the message will also let them  that if they click the first star , it means  their experience with the task Creator was Very poor or unsatisfactory,  but if they click the second star button it means their experience with the task Creator was Poor or below expectations,  but if they click the Third star button it means their experience with the task Creator was Average or met expectations,  but if they click the fourth star button it means their experience with the task Creator was good or exceeded their expectations,  but if they click the 5th start button it means their experience with the task creator was excellent or outstanding, and the message (This message has an amharic version)  sent to the task creator will congratulate them in their success of delegating atleats 40 % of the task, the message will also thank them for doing their part, the message will also let them know that taskifii is  happy to include them [the task creator’s name ] as a trustworthy and valuable member of taskifii,  the message will also let them know that they have reached the final stage in which they have to rate the task doer [task doer’s name] from one star to five stars , the message will also let them know that it’s mandatory for them to rate the task doer before gaining access to use taskifii again, the message will also let them that if they click the first star button , it means their experience with the task doer was Very poor or unsatisfactory,  but  if they click the second star button it means their experience with the task doer was Poor or below expectations,  but if they click the Third star button it means their experience with the task doer was Average or met expectations,  but if they click the fourth star button it means their experience with the task doer was good or exceeded their expectations,  but if they click the 5th star button it means their experience with the task doer was excellent or outstanding. Then If the task doer clicks one of the 5 buttons , the color of the inside part of the star in the button clicked will turn to yellow as well as the ones before it (this is ofcourse if there any before it i.e if the user clicks the first star button in the left of the user’s point of view , the only star in a button in which the color  inside of the star will change to yellow will only be the first one that was clicked on because there is nothing before it) , then the buttons will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then a message (This message has an amharic version) will  be sent to the task doer letting them know that they have successfully rated the task creator , the message will also let them know that taskifii hopes they(the task doer) have enjoyed using the taskifii. But if the task creator clicks one of the 5 buttons , the color of the inside part of the star in the button clicked will turn to yellow as well as the ones before it (this is ofcourse if there any i.e if the user clicks the first star button in the left of the user’s point of view , the only star in a button in which the color  inside of the star will change to yellow will only be the first one that was clicked on because there is nothing before it), then the buttons will stop doing anything if they get clicked,  a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that they have successfully rated the task doer , the message will also let them know that taskifii hopes they(the task creator) have enjoyed using the taskifii. But if the task doer would have clicked the report to taskifii button (either one i.e if the task doer clicked the report to taskifii button within 5 minutes rather than clicking the give a week button next to it within 5 minutes or if the task doer would have clicked the report to taskifii button within a week rather than clicking the recieved button next to it within a week ) or if the task doer would have not clicked the recieved button or the report to taskifii button next to it within a week , the buttons (if the task doer would have clicked the report to taskifii button next to the give a week button within the 5 minutes , the give a week button and the report to taskifii button is what i mean by buttons here  but if the task doer where in the stage where they clicked the report to taskifii button next to the received button within a week , the recieved button and the report to taskifii button next to it is what i mean by buttons here)will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then  a message (This message has an amharic version)  will be sent  to the task doer letting them know that  taskifii has been notified about the report so they must wait till  taskifii studies this case and gets back to them(the task doers)  in which they(the task doer) can’t use taskifii till then . A message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has reported to taskifii that the task creator( in the message it will say “you”) did not send the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they shall wait till taskifii studies this case and gets back to them  in which they(the task creator) can’t use taskifii till then. Then the bot will ban the task doer and the task creator from using the bot as well as the group(the group i told you about earlier). Then the task post without the apply button, the related file(if the task creator gave a related file) , the middle 40% of the completed task the task doer sent, the task doer’s name with emphasis ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis ,the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the  task creator’s phone number with emphasis, and the receipt the task creator sent will all be sent to another private channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has  Five buttons attached below it labeled as “Contact Task Doer” , “Contact Task Creator”, “keep blocking task doer”, “keep blocking task creator”, and “Completed” . And the giant message will have two hashtags in it saying “#UnPaid” and “#UnCompleted” .  And if the contact task doer  button is clicked ,  it will take the user that clicked it, to the bot ,  and then  a message  will be sent to the user  through the bot  letting them know  that they should write a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then  if the user gives a message  or anything else,  it will be sent to the task doer.  But if the user clicks the contact task Creator button,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then a message will be sent to the user through the bot letting them know that they should write a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or anything else,  it would be sent to the task creator . 
 But  if the keep blocking task doer  button was clicked  by a user,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user  letting them know  that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task doer.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task doer later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task doer (i will explain how next) . Then  the bot  will send to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month” . And  then  if the user clicks  the day button , the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 days).  But if the user clicked the month button,  the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of months they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning  the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task doer is banned/kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task doer will then get 5 one-star reviews as if  5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task creator, the task creator  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator five-star reviews. Then in the giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task doer” (written in red color).  But if a user clicks the unblock task doer button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task doer . Then the bot will unban the task doer from the bot as well as the group.  But if a user clicked the keep blocking task creator button , it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task creator.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task creator later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task creator (i will explain how next). Then  the bot  will send  to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month”.  And then if the user clicks the day button , the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to keep on banning the task creator. Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 days). Then if the user gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier, then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task creator is kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task creator will then get 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task doer, the task doer  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-star reviews. Then in the then giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task creator” (written in Blue color). But if a user clicks the unblock task creator button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task creator . Then the bot will unban the task creator from the bot as well as the group. Okay but if the completed button is clicked , it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. I also want you to know that if the giant message will then have the text “The guilty is the task creator” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task creator button) and for the second time in the future, if the task creator gets the report to taskifii button clicked by a task doer on a task they posted , the then giant message will  have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task creator”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task creator again” , then the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task doer [half the task fee they(the task creator) planned to pay the first victim task doer] birr and till they pay the second victimized task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) were supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr , the message will also include both of the task doer’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doers, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task doer) letting them know that taskifii has found the task creator guilty so the task creator [task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii  . And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task doer a message letting them know that a previous task creator they have worked with in the past by the name [task creator’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task creator) did to them (the task doer) in the past to another task doer , the message will also let them know that because the task creator repeated their mistake again , the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they pay half of the task fee they were supposed to pay them (the task doer) to them (the task doer) plus another corresponding task fee to the other task doer, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task creator sends the monetary punishment they (the task doer) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task creator to only click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task doer, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they send as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that they must now send the receipt of payment for the second victimized task doer. Then if the task creator gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will exactly wait till the first victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task doer the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version), and the message will let them know that a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name] has finally sent the punishment fee of [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the first victimized task doer] birr to them(the first victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will also wait exactly till the second victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then bot will send to the second victimized task doer the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “ I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task creator was supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr to them(the second victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will ban(or keep on banning) the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s telegram username, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to first victimized task doer], the task creator’s telegram username, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#FVTD” ,and “#unpaid2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button (which i will explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (first victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews each as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task doer would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task doer clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (and obviously fyi ,this sent button will appear  if the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens with more details , for now just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message(This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because both the task doers have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. Then also the bot will give the task creator 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews and the bot will also give both the task doer 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creator gave the task doer five-stars.And btw ,I forgot to tell you that ,as soon as the first victimized task doer or the second victimized task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task doer would have clicked the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task doer  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then the second receipt , the second victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s telegram username,  the second victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis ,the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to second victimized task doer] birr,  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#SVTD” ,and “#unpaid2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button  is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doers five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task creator again” text in it  and  for the third time or more in the future, if the task creator gets the report to taskifii button clicked by a task doer on a task they posted , then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttc”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task creator is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttc button , the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e making the task doer fix a mistake outside of the task description) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) was going to pay by the task doer] birr , the message will also include the task doer’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that after taskifii studied the case , the task creator has been found guilty so the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer). And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task creator to click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task creator) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), the bot will exactly wait till the task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,then the bot will send to the task doer the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the task doer] birr to them (the task doer), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task doer’s name with emphasis ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the task creator’s name with emphasis, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task creator’s email address with emphasis, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#TD” ,and “#unpaid3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions.  And as i told you before, the task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because  the task doer have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then also the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 



Okay going back now, I also want you to know that if the giant message would have had the text “The guilty is the task doer” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task doer button) and next time if the task doer gets in the situation like this for the for the second time in the future (i.e in the future for the second time, if the task doer clicks the report to taskifii button for another task)   , the then giant message  sent will have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task doer”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task doer again”,  then the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first or the former victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr and till they pay the second or the current victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task creator) letting them know that taskifii has found the task doer guilty so the task doer [task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee/ monetary punishment fee to them(the task creators), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii. And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task creator a message letting them know that a previous task doer they have worked with in the past by the name [task doer’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task doer) did to them (the task creator) in the past to another task creator(a.k.a the second victimized task creator) , the message will also let them know that because the task doer repeated their mistake again , the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half of the task fee they were supposed to get paid by  them (the task creator)initially  to them (the task creator) plus another corresponding monetary punishment fee to the other task creator, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task doer sends the monetary punishment fee they (the task creator) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that they must give the receipt of payment for the second victimized task creator . Then if the task doer gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will wait exactly till the first victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task creator the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr to them(the first victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then also when the second victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,  bot will send to the second victimized task creator the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator] birr to them(the second victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t, they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task creator’s name with emphasis ,the first victimized task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the first victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr,  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”.

Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because  the task creator have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task creator  clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed.
 And if the task doer would have clicked the non-agreed upon button before the time to click the non-agreed upon button was up, a message with a button attached below it labeled as “Cancel this report” will be sent to the task doer letting them know that they should send a message that explains at least one thing that is a non agreed upon work outside of the task description that the task creator insisted them(the task doer) to fix in the completed task/40 % of it , the message will also let them know that they got 5 minutes to send the message or they won’t get another chance to report this. Then if the task doer doesn’t send a message within 5 minutes or if the task doer clicks the cancel this report button within 5 minutes   , the cancel this report button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked , then the bot will wait till the task doer sends the updated and completed task before the revision time is up, in which if they do or not , the exact same thing or process will happen as i told earlier (i.e the process  i told you of what happens if the task doer sends the updated and completed task before the revision time is up rather than clicking the non agreed upon button ) (the part where i explain when they don’t is described a bit later).  But if the task doer would have sent a message or something to the bot within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button ,  the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has claimed that the task creator (in the message it will say “you”) is insisting them(the task doer) to fix something that is a non agreed upon extra work outside of the task description,  the message will also let them know that taskifii will get to the bottom of this and punish the one who is found guilty, the message will also let the task creator know that the taskifii team has a lot complaints like this to resolve so it might take a while till taskifii studies this case , the message will also let them know that they (the task creator) can’t unfortunately use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this.  And also from the task doer side a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent letting them know that they have successfully sent the report claim to taskifii, the message will also let them know that they shall wait till taskifii team studies this case and gets to the bottom of it , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this. Then both the task doer and the task creator will be banned from using both the group and this bot until i can study this case and confirm the one who is guilty and the way this happens is once the task doer gives a message or anything within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button , the message or something the task creator sent within the 15% of the revision time after clicking the fix button , the middle 40% of the completed task , the updated and the completed task (of the middle 40%), the message the task doer sent within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button , the related file (if there is any), the task post without the apply button, the task doer’s name with emphasis ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, and the  task creator’s phone number with emphasis will all be sent to another channel (which has the chat id :--1002432632907) as one giant message(which will have two hashtags in it saying “#nonagreedupon” and “#UnCompleted”) with seven buttons  attached below it labeled as “Contact Task Doer” , “Contact Task Creator”, “ keep blocking task doer”, “keep blocking task creator”, “Unblock task doer”, “Unblock Task creator” and “Completed” .  And if the contact task doer  button is clicked ,  it will take the user that clicked it, to the bot ,  and then  a message  will be sent to the user  through the bot  letting them know  that they should write a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then  if the user gives a message  or anything else,  it will be sent to the task doer.  But if the user clicks the contact task Creator button,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then a message will be sent to the user through the bot letting them know that they should write a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or anything else,  it would be sent to the task creator . 
 But  if the keep blocking task doer  button was clicked  by a user,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user  letting them know  that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task doer.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task doer later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task doer (i will explain how next) . Then  the bot  will send to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month” . And  then  if the user clicks  the day button , the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 days).  But if the user clicked the month button,  the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of months they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning  the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task doer is banned/kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task doer will then get 5 one-star reviews as if  5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task creator, the task creator  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator five-star reviews. Then in the giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task doer” (written in red color).  But if a user clicks the unblock task doer button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task doer . Then the bot will unban the task doer from the bot as well as the group.  But if a user clicked the keep blocking task creator button , it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task creator.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task creator later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task creator (i will explain how next). Then  the bot  will send  to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month”.  And then if the user clicks the day button , the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to keep on banning the task creator. Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 days). Then if the user gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier, then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task creator is kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task creator will then get 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task doer, the task doer  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-star reviews. Then in the then giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task creator” (written in Blue color). But if a user clicks the unblock task creator button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task creator . Then the bot will unban the task creator from the bot as well as the group. Okay but if the completed button is clicked , it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. I also want you to know that if the giant message will then have the text “The guilty is the task creator” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task creator button) and for the second time ,if the task creator gets a non agreed upon report from a task doer in the future (i.e if task doer sends a message within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button) , the giant message will then have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task creator”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task creator again” , then the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task doer [half the task fee they(the task creator) planned to pay the first victim task doer] birr and till they pay the second victimized task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) were supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr , the message will also include both of the task doer’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doers, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task doer will be un banned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task doer) letting them know that taskifii has found the task creator guilty so the task creator [task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii  . And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task doer a message letting them know that a previous task creator they have worked with in the past by the name [task creator’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task creator) did to them (the task doer) in the past to another task doer , the message will also let them know that because the task creator repeated their mistake again , the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they pay half of the task fee they were supposed to pay them (the task doer) to them (the task doer) plus another corresponding task fee to the other task doer, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task creator sends the monetary punishment they (the task doer) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task creator to only click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task doer, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they send as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that they must now send the receipt of payment for the second victimized task doer. Then if the task creator gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will exactly wait till the first victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task doer the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version), and the message will let them know that a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name] has finally sent the punishment fee of [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the first victimized task doer] birr to them(the first victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will also wait exactly till the second victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then bot will send to the second victimized task doer the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “ I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task creator was supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr to them(the second victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will ban(or keep on banning) the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s telegram username, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to first victimized task doer], the task creator’s telegram username, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#FVTD” ,and “#nonagreedupon2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button (which i will explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (first victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews each as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task doer would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task doer clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (and obviously fyi ,this sent button will appear  if the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens with more details , for now just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message(This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because both the task doers have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. Then also the bot will give the task creator 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews and the bot will also give both the task doer 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creator gave the task doer five-stars.And btw ,I forgot to tell you that ,as soon as the first victimized task doer or the second victimized task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task doer would have clicked the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task doer  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then the second receipt , the second victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s telegram username,  the second victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis ,the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to second victimized task doer] birr,  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#SVTD” ,and “#nonagreedupon2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions.

Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews.

Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task creator again” text in it  and for the third time or more ,if the task creator gets a non agreed upon report from a task doer in the future (i.e for the third time or more in the future , if a task doer sends a message within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button for a task), then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttc”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task creator is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttc button , the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e trying to make the task doer fix a mistake that wasn’t theirs) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) was going to pay by the task doer] birr , the message will also include the task doer’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that after taskifii studied the case , the task creator has been found guilty so the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer).

Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because  the task doer have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then also the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 



Okay going back now, I also want you to know that if the giant message would have had the text “The guilty is the task doer” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task doer button) and for the second time  ,if the task doer gives a non agreed upon report in in the future (i.e for the second time in the future , if the task doer sends a message within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button) , the then giant message  sent will have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task doer”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task doer again”,  then the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first or the former victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr and till they pay the second or the current victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task creator) letting them know that taskifii has found the task doer guilty so the task doer [task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee/ monetary punishment fee to them(the task creators), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii. And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task creator a message letting them know that a previous task doer they have worked with in the past by the name [task doer’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task doer) did to them (the task creator) in the past to another task creator(a.k.a the second victimized task creator) , the message will also let them know that because the task doer repeated their mistake again , the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half of the task fee they were supposed to get paid by  them (the task creator)initially  to them (the task creator) plus another corresponding monetary punishment fee to the other task creator, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task doer sends the monetary punishment fee they (the task creator) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that they must give the receipt of payment for the second victimized task creator . Then if the task doer gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will wait exactly till the first victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task creator the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr to them(the first victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then also when the second victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,  bot will send to the second victimized task creator the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator] birr to them(the second victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t, they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task creator’s name with emphasis ,the first victimized task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the first victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr,  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#FVTC” ,and “#nonagreedupon2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the first victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist),  the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( first victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (this is ofcourse if the second victimized task creator clicked the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens, just know there is a sent button involved in it ) (btw the same goes vice versa i.e if a user clicked the sent button or if the second victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the first victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that because both the task creators have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the first victimized task creator or the second victimized task creator clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button,both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task creator  will be unbanned from the bot and the group, then  the second receipt , the second victimized task creator’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis ,the second victimized task creator’s telegram username ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee of the task the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator],  task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#SVTC” ,and “#nonagreedupon2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions.

Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars each .

Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task doer again” text in it  and for the third time or more ,if the task doer gives a non agreed upon report  in the future (i.e for the third time or morein the future , if the task doer sends a message within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button for a task), then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttd”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task doer is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttd button , the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e lying by saying that the task creator insisted them(the task doer) fix a mistake that wasn’t theirs to fix) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the task creator] birr , the message will also include  task creator’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that after taskifii studied the case ,the task doer has been found guilty so the task doer  has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creator).

 Okay now moving on, i forgot to tell you that If the task Doer would have sent the middle 40% of the completed task within the time given to finish and submit the completed task a.k.a time given for the task,  firstly the  violation button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked(if the completed task was sent before the time to click the violation button was up),  then the same thing would happen as if the task doer would have sent the completed task / 40 % of it after the time given for the task was up but before the task fee reached zero (in which i explain somewhere in this instructions before(but there couple of changes i explain in it so read that part).  
 And btw i forgot to tell you that if the task doer wouldn’t have sent the completed task at all,  even within the time given for the task or even after that (i.e till task fee reaches zero) or if the task doer wouldn’t have sent  the updated and completed  task within 40 % of the the revision time , a message will be sent to the task doer letting them know that they have been banned from taskifii for 5 months for not meeting their obligations, the message will also let them know that if they repeat this action again , there will be some monetary punishment to pay. Then the bot will ban the task doer from the bot and the group for 5 months. Then after the 5 months are up (i.e after the task doer is no longer banned from the bot and the group), the Bot will send a message to the task doer letting them know that they can now start using taskifii ,  the message will also let them know that they should be careful in not repeating this action again otherwise next time there would be monetary punishments to pay. If the task doer repeats this mistake for the second time again i.e not send the completed task at all (i.e if they don’t send the completed task neither within the time given for the task nor after that ,till task fee reaches zero),  the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victim task creator] birr and till they pay the second victim task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victim task creator and the second task creator letting them know that the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creators). And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt .

Then if the task doer gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) and when the first victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , the bot will send to the first victimized task creator the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr to them(the first victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then also when the second victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,  bot will send to the second victimized task creator the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator] birr to them(the second victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t, they must click the i deny button.

If the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task creator’s name with emphasis ,the first victimized task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the first victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator],  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#FVTC” ,and “#undelivered2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the first victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( first victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (this is ofcourse if the second victimized task creator clicked the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens, just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because both the task creators have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the first victimized task creator or the second victimized task creator clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task creator  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then  the second receipt , the second victimized task creator’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis ,the second victimized task creator’s telegram username ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee of the task the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator],  task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#SVTC” ,and “#undelivered2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars each . Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 
If the task doer repeats this mistake ( i.e not send the completed task at all (i.e if they don’t send the completed task neither within the time given for the task nor after that ,till task fee reaches zero) ) for the third time or more, the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has completed studying the case and taskifii has found them guilty by a situation like this for the third time or more (i.e not sending the completed task at all ( neither within the time given for the task nor after that ,till task fee reaches zero) for the third time or more ) so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the task creator] birr , the message will also include  task creator’s name(with emphasis) and all their (the task creator’s) banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creator). And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task doer) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), when the task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , the bot will send to the task creator the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator] birr to them (the task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task creator’s name with emphasis ,the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#TC” ,and “#undelivered3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because  the task creator have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task creator  clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 









Now i'm going to tell what happens if the task doer clicks the approve button in which the task doer would have sent the middle 40% of the completed task within the time given for the task  , which is that ,the bot will resume waiting for task doer to send the final 30% of the task within the time given for the task or till task fee reaches zero (if the task doer failed to send the final 30% of the task within the time given for the task (keep on reading , you will understand what i mean))(and if you forgot in case when the bot paused waiting , the bot paused waiting when the task doer sent the middle 40% of the completed task in time) ,then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer every 20% of the remaining time till the time given for the task is up, and the message will let the task doer know that they got [the remaining till the time given for the task is up] to submit the rest of the completed task to the bot so that they must send the final 30% of the task quickly. But the bot will only keep on sending this message to the task doer till either  the task doer sends the rest of the completed task(the final 30% of the completed task) to the bot within the time given for the task or till the time given for the task is up .   Okay moving on, before i tell you the rest of the things of what happens if the task doer clicks the approve button in which the task doer would have sent the middle 40% of the completed task within the time given for the task, i want to first tell you what happens If the task doer doesn’t send the completed task/the final 30% of the completed task within the time given for the task , which is that an alertful message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task doer every 20% of the remaining time til the task fee reaches zero amount (sorry for confusing you, the reason why task fee will reach zero amount is because the birr amount deducted per hour from the task fee(the task creator would have given this earlier in task inquiry format) will start being deducted from the task fee every hour once the task doer missed the chance to send the final 50% of the completed within the time given to do the task) and the messages will be kept on being sent to the task doer til either the task doer sends the completed task or the final 30% of it within the remaining time till task fee reaches zero amount or till the task fee reaches zero, the message will warn them that they were late to submit the rest of the completed task/the final 30% of it  so starting from the current time  [birr amount deducted  per hour from task fee] birr  (the task creator gave this  earlier in the task inquiry format) will be deducted from their task fee till either the task fee reaches zero birr amount or til they send the final 30% of the completed task before task fee reaches zero, the message will also let them know that if the task fee reaches zero amount before they submit the final 30% of the completed task to the bot, they will be banned from using taskifii for 5 months and if they repeat this mistake again, there would be a monetary punishment to use taskifii again i.e they will pay half the task fee to the former victim task creator and the new victim task creator, the message  will also let them know that they got [the remaining time til the task fee reaches zero] to submit the task . 
And also an alertful message (This message has an amharic version)  will be sent to the task creator every 20% of the remaining time til the task fee reaches zero amount (the reason why it will reach zero amount is because the birr amount deducted per hour from the task fee (the task creator would have given this earlier) will start being deducted from the task fee every hour once the task doer missed the chance to send the completed task  with in the time given to do the task and til either the task doer sends the completed task within the remaining time till task fee reaches zero amount or till the task fee reaches zero amount) , and the message let’s them know that the task doer hasn’t  delivered the final 30%of the completed task within the time given for the task , the message will also let them know that  [ the birr amount deducted per hour from task fee] birr will be deducted from the task fee every hour till either the task fee reaches zero amount or til the task doer sends the final 30% of the completed task before the task fee reaches zero amount. 
Okay then if the task doer sends the rest of the completed task(i.e the final 30% of the completed task) before the task fee reaches zero amount ,  then the rest of the completed task the task doer sent  would be sent to the task creator with a message (This message has an amharic version) attached  below it  and the message will have two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Fix” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Continue” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that the task doer has sent this final 30% of the completed task to them,  the message will also let them know that they must check for any errors or mistakes  made by the task doer,  the message will also let them  that if they find  an   error or mistake  made by the task Doer ,they(the task creator) can notify and make the task Doer  fix whatever the error or mistake they(the task doer) made,  the message will also let them know that they got [ 15% of the Revision Time] (the task doer gave earlier in the task inquiry) to click the fix button and give a message that will be sent to the  task doer to fix any mistakes they might have made ,  the message will also let them know that  the  task doer  will fix the mistakes  and send the updated and  completed task within [the remaining time till 30% of the revision time is up ], the  message will also let them know that if they click  the  continue button  it means that there is no error or mistake in the final 30% of the completed task the task doer sent ,  the message will also let them know that if they click the continue button,  it means  that they they want to move on ,  the message will also let them know  that if they don't click the fix button within [the 15% of the revision time] , it's going to be taken as the rest of the completed task sent has no error or mistakes in it.  And also while this message is being sent to task creator, another message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task doer  letting them know that they have successfully sent the rest 30% of the completed task,  the message will also let them know that the task Creator is reviewing and checking for any kind of errors or mistakes they(the task doer) might have made,  the message will also let them know that the task creator has [the  15% of the revision time] to notify them(the task doers) about any kind of errors or mistakes they(the task doers) might have made so that they (task doers)can quickly fix them and send the updated ,correct and  completed task here (to the bot), the message will also let the task doer know that they must  wait attentively for at most [the 15% of the revision time] til/ if the task creator notifies about a potential mistake or error they (the task doer) must fix so that they(the task doer) can use their remaining time effectively til the time given to send the updated and completed task is up  . Then after both this messages is sent to the receivers  , and then  if the task creator clicks the fix button  before the  15% of the revision time has passed, a message (This message has an amharic version)  with a button attached below it labeled as “Accidental Request” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator letting them know that they should write  one message letting the task doer know every mistakes & errors they(the task doer) must fix, the message will also let them know that they must make everything clear for the task doer to understand , the message will also let them know that they got [the remaining time til the  15% of the revision time is up] to send the message here(to the bot), The message will also let them know that if they click The Accidental request button it means that the final 30% of the completed task sent by the task Doer  has no errors or mistakes in it so they( the task creator)  should be aware of that if they click The Accidental request button once ,there is no going back. Before i continue , i forgot to tell you that a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator every 20 % of the  15% of the revision time  till they either click the fix button or the continue button , and the message let’s them know how much time they got to click the fix button and notify the task doer any errors or mistakes to fix if there is any,  the message will also let them know that if they click the continue button before [the remaining time til the  15% of the revision time is up] or if they don’t click any of the two buttons  within  [the remaining time till the 15% of the  revision time is up],  it means that  there's no error or mistake  with the rest of the completed task the task doer has sent . Moving on,  as i told you earlier , if the task creator clicks the fix button, firstly the fix button and the continue button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, and then  a message (This message has an amharic version)  with the button attached below it  labeled as  “Accidental Request”  (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator, and i also told you what the message states but i forgot to tell you that after the task creator clicks the fix button , the bot will also send a separate message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator   every 20% of the remaining time till the 15% of the revision time is up letting them know that they got [remaining time til the  15% of the revision time is up] to send the message that notifies the task doer what mistakes or errors to fix; But also  the bot will only keep on sending this messages till either the  15% of the revision time is up or till the task creator sends something(anything) to the bot before the  15% of the revision time is up. Moving on, if the task creator clicks the fix button and  then sends a message or anything else that notifies the task Doer the mistakes they should fix within the time i stated earlier, the message or whatever the task creator sent plus a separate message (This message has an amharic version)  with a button attached below it labeled as “Non-Agreed upon” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent  to the task doer, and if it is a message the task creator sent, then it will be sent to the task doer in quotations letting the task doer know the task creator sent this message and the separate message sent to the task doer will let them(the task doer) know that the task creator wants them(the task doers) to fix the mistakes described above that they(the task doer) might have made , the separate message will also let them know that they got [ the remaining time til the 30% of the  revision time is up] to submit the corrected and finalized task,  the separate message will also let them know that if the task creator is trying to make them(the task doers) fix a mistake or error that they (the task doer) didn’t make i.e anything not described in the task description, they can click the non-agreed upon button below , the separate message will also let them know that if they plan to click the non-agreed upon button , they must click it within [the first 15% of the remaining time till 30% of the revision time is up]. A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the notification  is successfully sent to the task doer. Then if the task doer doesn’t click the non-agreed upon button within the first 15% of the remaining time till the 30% of the revision time is up or if the task doer sends the updated and completed task within the first 15% of the remaining time till the 30% of the revision time is up , the non-agreed upon button will stop doing anything .Then  if the task doer sends to the bot the updated and the completed task(the final 30% of it fyi) before 30% of the revision time is up , the updated and the completed task  and a separate message (This message has an amharic version)  below it that has two button below it labeled as “Not Fixed” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Fixed” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator , the message lets the task creator know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has sent the updated and the completed task above, the message also lets them know that if everything is fixed in the updated and the completed task, they can click the Fixed button below, but if something is not fixed in the  the updated and the completed task , they can click the Not Fixed button below, the message will also let them know that they must click one of the two buttons below within 20 minutes or taskifii will take it as if  they(the task creator) clicked the fixed button. And also a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator every 5 minutes for 20 minutes( until the task creator clicks either button within 20 minutes or till the 20 minutes are up)  letting them know how much time they got to click any of the two buttons till their 20 minutes are up .  Then if the task creator clicks the Fixed button within 20 minutes or if the task creator doesn’t click any of the two buttons within 20 minutes , same thing will happen as if the continue button was clicked(read the whole instructions to understand) i.e the fixed button and the continue button have the same function when clicked(the only difference they have is their button label, and also as you will see, when the continue button is clicked, the continue button and the fix button will then stop doing anything if they get clicked, but in this case , the fixed button and the not fixed button are the ones that will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, but all the rest of the things are the same) . But if the task creator clicks the not fixed button , the fixed button and the not fixed button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked , then a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator letting them know that this case will be studied by taskifii, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii reaches out to them. A message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that the task creator has claimed that something was not fixed in the updated and the completed task ,  the  message will also let them know that this case will be studied by taskifii, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii reaches out to them.  Then both the task doer and the task creator will be banned from using the bot and the group.  Then the Task post without the apply button, the related file(if the task creator gave a related file) , the completed task the task doer sent first, the updated and completed task the task doer sent , the notification message (or something else) the task creator sent that let the task doer know what errors or mistakes to fix,  the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the  task creator’s phone number with emphasis, and the receipt the task creator sent will all be sent to another private channel that has a chat id of “-1002432632907” as one giant message that has  Five buttons attached below it labeled as “Contact Task Doer” , “Contact Task Creator”, “ keep blocking task doer”, “keep blocking task creator”, and “Completed” . And the giant message will have two hashtags in it saying “#Mistake” and “#UnCompleted”  .And if the contact task doer  button is clicked ,  it will take the user that clicked it, to the bot ,  and then  a message  will be sent to the user  through the bot  letting them know  that they should write a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then  if the user gives a message  or anything else,  it will be sent to the task doer.  But if the user clicks the contact task Creator button,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then a message will be sent to the user through the bot letting them know that they should write a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or anything else,  it would be sent to the task creator . 
 But  if the keep blocking task doer  button was clicked  by a user,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user  letting them know  that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task doer.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task doer later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task doer (i will explain how next) . Then  the bot  will send to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month” . And  then  if the user clicks  the day button , the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 days).  But if the user clicked the month button,  the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of months they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning  the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task doer is banned/kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task doer will then get 5 one-star reviews as if  5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task creator, the task creator  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator five-star reviews. Then in the giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task doer” (written in red color).  But if a user clicks the unblock task doer button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task doer . Then the bot will unban the task doer from the bot as well as the group.  But if a user clicked the keep blocking task creator button , it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task creator.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task creator later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task creator (i will explain how next). Then  the bot  will send  to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month”.  And then if the user clicks the day button , the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to keep on banning the task creator. Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 days). Then if the user gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier, then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task creator is kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task creator will then get 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task doer, the task doer  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-star reviews. Then in the then giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task creator” (written in Blue color). But if a user clicks the unblock task creator button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task creator . Then the bot will unban the task creator from the bot as well as the group. Okay but if the completed button is clicked , it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. I also want you to know that if the giant message will then have the text “The guilty is the task creator” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task creator button) and next time if the task creator clicks the not fixed button for another task for the for the second time  , the then giant message will  have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task creator”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task creator again” , then the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task doer [half the task fee they(the task creator) planned to pay the first victim task doer] birr and till they pay the second victimized task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) were supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr , the message will also include both of the task doer’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doers, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task doer) letting them know that taskifii has found the task creator guilty so the task creator [task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii  . And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task doer a message letting them know that a previous task creator they have worked with in the past by the name [task creator’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task creator) did to them (the task doer) in the past to another task doer , the message will also let them know that because the task creator repeated their mistake again , the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they pay half of the task fee they were supposed to pay them (the task doer) to them (the task doer) plus another corresponding task fee to the other task doer, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task creator sends the monetary punishment they (the task doer) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task creator to only click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task doer, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they send as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that they must now send the receipt of payment for the second victimized task doer. Then if the task creator gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will exactly wait till the first victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task doer the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version), and the message will let them know that a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name] has finally sent the punishment fee of [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the first victimized task doer] birr to them(the first victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will also wait exactly till the second victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then bot will send to the second victimized task doer the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “ I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task creator was supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr to them(the second victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will ban(or keep on banning) the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s telegram username, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to first victimized task doer], the task creator’s telegram username, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#FVTD” ,and “#mistake2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button (which i will explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (first victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews each as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task doer would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task doer clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (and obviously fyi ,this sent button will appear  if the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens with more details , for now just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message(This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because both the task doers have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. Then also the bot will give the task creator 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews and the bot will also give both the task doer 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creator gave the task doer five-stars.And btw ,I forgot to tell you that ,as soon as the first victimized task doer or the second victimized task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task doer would have clicked the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task doer  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then the second receipt , the second victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s telegram username,  the second victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis ,the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to second victimized task doer] birr,  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#SVTD” ,and “#mistake2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button  is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doers five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii.

Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task creator again” text in it  and if the task creator clicks the not fixed button for another task for the third time or more in the future , then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttc”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task creator is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttc button , the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e trying to make the task doer fix a mistake outside of the task description) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) was going to pay by the task doer] birr , the message will also include the task doer’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that after taskifii studied the case , the task creator has been found guilty so the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer). And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task creator to click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task creator) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt .

Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions.  And as i told you before, the task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews.

Okay going back now, I also want you to know that if the giant message would have had the text “The guilty is the task doer” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task doer button) and next time if the task doer gets in the situation like this for the for the second time in the future (i.e in the future for the second time, if a task creator clicks the not fixed button for a task  the task doer worked on/ was working on)   , the then giant message  sent will have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task doer”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task doer again”,  then the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first or the former victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr and till they pay the second or the current victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task creator) letting them know that taskifii has found the task doer guilty so the task doer [task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee/ monetary punishment fee to them(the task creators), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii. And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task creator a message letting them know that a previous task doer they have worked with in the past by the name [task doer’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task doer) did to them (the task creator) in the past to another task creator(a.k.a the second victimized task creator) , the message will also let them know that because the task doer repeated their mistake again , the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half of the task fee they were supposed to get paid by  them (the task creator)initially  to them (the task creator) plus another corresponding monetary punishment fee to the other task creator, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task doer sends the monetary punishment fee they (the task creator) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that they must give the receipt of payment for the second victimized task creator . Then if the task doer gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will wait exactly till the first victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task creator the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr to them(the first victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then also when the second victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,  bot will send to the second victimized task creator the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator] birr to them(the second victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t, they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task creator’s name with emphasis ,the first victimized task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the first victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr,  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#FVTC” ,and “#mistake2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the first victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist),  the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( first victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (this is ofcourse if the second victimized task creator clicked the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens, just know there is a sent button involved in it ) (btw the same goes vice versa i.e if a user clicked the sent button or if the second victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the first victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that because both the task creators have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the first victimized task creator or the second victimized task creator clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button,both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task creator  will be unbanned from the bot and the group, then  the second receipt , the second victimized task creator’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis ,the second victimized task creator’s telegram username ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee of the task the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator],  task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#SVTC” ,and “#mistake2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars each . Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task doer again” text in it  and if the task doer gets in the situation like this  for the third time or more in the future (i.e in the future for the third time or more, if a task creator clicks the not fixed button for a task the task doer worked on/was working on )  , then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttd”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task doer is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttd button , the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e not fixing the mistakes they made in the task in time) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the task creator] birr , the message will also include  task creator’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that after taskifii studied the case ,the task doer has been found guilty so the task doer  has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creator). And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task doer) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), when the task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , the bot will send to the task creator the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator] birr to them (the task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task creator’s name with emphasis ,the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#TC” ,and “#mistake3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because  the task creator have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task creator  clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 

Okay i forgot to tell you thatIf the task creator doesn’t click  the fix button or the continue button within the  15% of the revision time or if the task creator  doesn’t send something to the bot within the  15% of the revision time after clicking the fix button or if the task creator doesn’t click the accidental request button within the 15% of the revision time after clicking the fix button or if the task creator clicks the continue button within the 25% of the revision time or if the task creator clicks the fixed button within its time or if the task creator clicks the accidental request within it’s time,   the accidental request button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked(this is ofcourse if the task creator clicked the fix button but then after that ,did not either click the accidental request button within the 15% of the revision time or send something to the bot with the  15% of the revision time) , then all the online banking details of the task doer , the task doer’s name , and a message (This message has an amharic version) below them will be sent to the task creator , the message will let the task creator know that they will choose the task doer’s online banking detail/s of their convenience above to send the task fee to them(the task doer) within exactly 30 minutes, the message will also let them know that after they send the money , they must send the the receipt here(to the bot) with in 30 minutes and that it doesn’t matter what format the receipt is (it can be a screenshot , pdf, link, ...etc…) . Then after all of this are sent to the task creator,  if the task creator sends something to the bot within 30 minutes,  whatever the task Creator sent to the bot  will be  sent to the task doer  with a message (This message has an amharic version)  and two buttons  attached below the message  labeled as “Approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Deny” (This button label has an amharic version),  the message  will let the task doer know that  the task creator has  claimed  that they ( the task creator)have sent  the task fee to  them (the task doer) ,  the message will also let them know that the task creator has sent  this file(whatever the task creator sent as a receipt)  as a proof that they have paid the task fee to them( the task  doer) ,  the message will also let them know that they must check if they have received the task fee  from the task creator  in which if they did , they can click the approve button below  but if they didn't receive any kind of task fee from the task creator,  they can click the deny button below, the message will also let them know that they got 5 minutes to click one of the buttons below otherwise taskifii will automatically assume that they (the task doer) have recieved the task fee so they must be quick to give an answer in 5 minutes, the message will also let them know that [the total birr amount deducted from the task fee before the task doer sent the completed task ] birr has been deducted from the task fee of [task fee] so they will get paid  [total birr amount deducted from the task fee before the task doer sent the completed task subtracted from the task fee] birr!. A message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the reciept has been successfully sent to the task doer , the message will also let them know that they must wait at most 5 minutes till the task doer confirms that they(the task doer) recieved the task fee.  And if the task doer clicks the approve button within the 5 minutes or if the task doer doesn’t click any of the two buttons within 5 minutes, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) with 5 buttons (This button label has an amharic version) attached below it (each labeled with star emoji that in which the color inside the star is not yellow but the color of the button meaning this “ ☆”, and the buttons must be arranged in one horizontal line in which every buttons are next to each other) to the task doer and the task creator, the message sent to the task doer will congratulate them in their success of finishing and delivering the completed task, the message will also thank them for doing their part , the message will also let them know that taskifii is happy to include  [the task doer’s name] as a trustworthy , responsible and valuable member of Taskifii , the message will also let them know that they have reached the final stage in which they have to rate the task creator [task creator’s name] from one star to five stars , the message will also let them know that it’s mandatory for them to rate the task creator before gaining access to use taskifii again, the message will also let them  that if they click the first star , it means  their experience with the task Creator was Very poor or unsatisfactory,  but if they click the second star button it means their experience with the task Creator was Poor or below expectations,  but if they click the Third star button it means their experience with the task Creator was Average or met expectations,  but if they click the fourth star button it means their experience with the task Creator was good or exceeded their expectations,  but if they click the 5th start button it means their experience with the task creator was excellent or outstanding, and the message sent to the task creator will congratulate them in their success of delegating a task, the message will also thank them for doing their part, the message will also let them know that taskifii is  happy to include them [the task creator’s name ] as a trustworthy and valuable member of taskifii,  the message will also let them know that they have reached the final stage in which they have to rate the task doer [task doer’s name] from one star to five stars , the message will also let them know that it’s mandatory for them to rate the task doer before gaining access to use taskifii again, the message will also let them that if they click the first star button , it means their experience with the task doer was Very poor or unsatisfactory,  but  if they click the second star button it means their experience with the task doer was Poor or below expectations,  but if they click the Third star button it means their experience with the task doer was Average or met expectations,  but if they click the fourth star button it means their experience with the task doer was good or exceeded their expectations,  but if they click the 5th star button it means their experience with the task doer was excellent or outstanding. Then If the task doer clicks one of the 5 buttons , the color of the inside part of the star in the button clicked will turn to yellow as well as the ones before it (this is ofcourse if there any before it i.e if the user clicks the first star button in the left of the user’s point of view , the only star in a button in which the color  inside of the star will change to yellow will only be the first one that was clicked on because there is nothing before it) , then the buttons will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then a message (This message has an amharic version) will  be sent to the task doer letting them know that they have successfully rated the task creator , the message will also let them know that taskifii hopes they(the task doer) have enjoyed using the taskifii. But if the task creator clicks one of the 5 buttons , the color of the inside part of the star in the button clicked will turn to yellow as well as the ones before it (this is ofcourse if there any i.e if the user clicks the first star button in the left of the user’s point of view , the only star in a button in which the color  inside of the star will change to yellow will only be the first one that was clicked on because there is nothing before it), then the buttons will stop doing anything if they get clicked,  a message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that they have successfully rated the task doer , the message will also let them know that taskifii hopes they(the task creator) have enjoyed using the taskifii. 

 But if the task doer clicks the deny button before the 5 minutes are up, a message (This message has an amharic version)  with two buttons attached below it labeled as “Give a Week” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Report to Taskifii” (This button label has an amharic version) will be sent to the task doer letting them know that sometimes it might be network reasons or transaction delay reasons  so if they want to give it a week till the money potentially arrives to their bank account ,  they can click the give a week button , the message will also let them know that if they click the give a week button , they and the task creator [the task creator’s name] won’t be able to use taskifii till they either recieve the taskfee (and notify taskifii that they recieved it) within a week or till the week is up in which taskifii will get to the bottom of this and punish the one who is found guilty , the message will also let them know that if they want the taskifii team to get to the bottom of this as soon as possible, they can click the report to taskifii button, the message will aslo let them know that the taskifii team is a bit busy with other reports like theirs so they shall wait till taskifii studies their case , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this and reaches out to them, the message will also warn them to click one of the buttons below within 5 minutes otherwise taskifii will assume that they recieved the task fee. And a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has denied that they have recieved the task fee so now they (the task creator) must wait to see if the task doer either wishes to wait a week to recieve the task fee or report this case to taskifii. Then if the task doer clicks the give a week button  ,  the give a week button and the report to taskifii button will now stop doing anything if they get clicked , then a message (This message has an amharic version) with two buttons attached below it labeled as “Received” (This button label has an amharic version) and “Report to Taskifii” (This button label has an amharic version) (yes, this button will do the same thing as the one before in which i will tell you later what it does if it gets clicked)   will be sent to the task doer letting them know that they must click the received button if they have received the task fee before the week is up, the message will also let them know that once the week is up and they haven’t clicked the received button , taskifii will study this case and give the right measurement to whomever is found guilty, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they recieve the task fee and click the recieved button within a week or till taskifii studies this case(if they clicked the report to taskifii button ). But i before i continue i want you to know that from earlier if it was a situation where the task doer doesn’t click the give a week button or the report to taskifii button next to it in time (the time i told you earlier) or even now if the task doer clicks the recieved button within a week (i know it’s confusing what i said but since both of these have the same result i decided to tell you what happens if either of the things happen), the buttons(if the task doer didn’t click the give a week button or the report to taskifii button within a week ,  the give a week button and the report to taskifii button is what i mean by buttons here  but if the task doer where in the stage where they clicked the recieved button within a week , the recieved button and the report to taskifii button next to it is what i mean by buttons here) will now stop doing anything if they get clicked , then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) with 5 buttons (This button label has an amharic version) attached below it (each labeled with star emoji that in which the color inside the star is not yellow but the color of the button meaning this “ ☆”, and the buttons must be arranged in one horizontal line in which every buttons are next to each other) to the task doer and the task creator, the message (This message has an amharic version)  sent to the task doer will congratulate them in their success of finishing and delivering the completed task, the message will also thank them for doing their part and using taskifii, the message will also let them know that taskifii is happy to include  [the task doer’s name] as a trustworthy , responsible and valuable member of Taskifii , the message will also let them know that they have reached the final stage in which they have to rate the task creator [task creator’s name] from one star to five stars , the message will also let them know that it’s mandatory for them to rate the task creator before gaining access to use taskifii again, the message will also let them  that if they click the first star , it means  their experience with the task Creator was Very poor or unsatisfactory,  but if they click the second star button it means their experience with the task Creator was Poor or below expectations,  but if they click the Third star button it means their experience with the task Creator was Average or met expectations,  but if they click the fourth star button it means their experience with the task Creator was good or exceeded their expectations,  but if they click the 5th start button it means their experience with the task creator was excellent or outstanding, and the message (This message has an amharic version)  sent to the task creator will congratulate them in their success of delegating a task, the message will also thank them for doing their part, the message will also let them know that taskifii is  happy to include them [the task creator’s name ] as a trustworthy and valuable member of taskifii,  the message will also let them know that they have reached the final stage in which they have to rate the task doer [task doer’s name] from one star to five stars , the message will also let them know that it’s mandatory for them to rate the task doer before gaining access to use taskifii again, the message will also let them that if they click the first star button , it means their experience with the task doer was Very poor or unsatisfactory,  but  if they click the second star button it means their experience with the task doer was Poor or below expectations,  but if they click the Third star button it means their experience with the task doer was Average or met expectations,  but if they click the fourth star button it means their experience with the task doer was good or exceeded their expectations,  but if they click the 5th star button it means their experience with the task doer was excellent or outstanding. Then If the task doer clicks one of the 5 buttons , the color of the inside part of the star in the button clicked will turn to yellow as well as the ones before it (this is ofcourse if there any before it i.e if the user clicks the first star button in the left of the user’s point of view , the only star in a button in which the color  inside of the star will change to yellow will only be the first one that was clicked on because there is nothing before it) , then the buttons will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then a message (This message has an amharic version) will  be sent to the task doer letting them know that they have successfully rated the task creator , the message will also let them know that taskifii hopes they(the task doer) have enjoyed using the taskifii. But if the task creator clicks one of the 5 buttons , the color of the inside part of the star in the button clicked will turn to yellow as well as the ones before it (this is ofcourse if there any i.e if the user clicks the first star button in the left of the user’s point of view , the only star in a button in which the color  inside of the star will change to yellow will only be the first one that was clicked on because there is nothing before it), then the buttons will stop doing anything if they get clicked,  a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that they have successfully rated the task doer , the message will also let them know that taskifii hopes they(the task creator) have enjoyed using the taskifii. But if the task doer would have clicked the report to taskifii button (either one i.e if the task doer clicked the report to taskifii button within 5 minutes rather than clicking the give a week button next to it within 5 minutes or if the task doer would have clicked the report to taskifii button within a week rather than clicking the recieved button next to it within a week ) or if the task doer would have not clicked the recieved button or the report to taskifii button next to it within a week , the buttons (if the task doer would have clicked the report to taskifii button next to the give a week button within the 5 minutes  ,  the give a week button and the report to taskifii button is what i mean by buttons here  but if the task doer where in the stage where they clicked the report to taskifii button next to the received button within a week , the recieved button and the report to taskifii button next to it is what i mean by buttons here)will now stop doing anything if they get clicked, then  a message (This message has an amharic version)  will be sent  to the task doer letting them know that  taskifii has been notified about the report so they must wait till  taskifii studies this case and gets back to them(the task doers)  in which they(the task doer) can’t use taskifii till then . A message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has reported to taskifii that the task creator( in the message it will say “you”) did not send the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they shall wait till taskifii studies this case and gets back to them  in which they(the task creator) can’t use taskifii till then. Then the bot will ban the task doer and the task creator from using the bot as well as the group(the group i told you about earlier). Then the Task post without the apply button, the related file(if the task creator gave a related file) , the completed task the task doer sent(all 3 of them), the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the  task creator’s phone number with emphasis, and the receipt the task creator sent will all be sent to another private channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has  Five buttons attached below it labeled as “Contact Task Doer” , “Contact Task Creator”, “keep blocking task doer”, “keep blocking task creator”, and “Completed” . And the giant message will have two hashtags in it saying “#UnPaid” and “#UnCompleted” .  And if the contact task doer  button is clicked ,  it will take the user that clicked it, to the bot ,  and then  a message  will be sent to the user  through the bot  letting them know  that they should write a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then  if the user gives a message  or anything else,  it will be sent to the task doer.  But if the user clicks the contact task Creator button,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then a message will be sent to the user through the bot letting them know that they should write a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or anything else,  it would be sent to the task creator . 
 But  if the keep blocking task doer  button was clicked  by a user,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user  letting them know  that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task doer.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task doer later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task doer (i will explain how next) . Then  the bot  will send to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month” . And  then  if the user clicks  the day button , the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 days).  But if the user clicked the month button,  the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of months they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning  the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task doer is banned/kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task doer will then get 5 one-star reviews as if  5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task creator, the task creator  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator five-star reviews. Then in the giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task doer” (written in red color).  But if a user clicks the unblock task doer button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task doer . Then the bot will unban the task doer from the bot as well as the group.  But if a user clicked the keep blocking task creator button , it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task creator.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task creator later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task creator (i will explain how next). Then  the bot  will send  to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month”.  And then if the user clicks the day button , the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to keep on banning the task creator. Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 days). Then if the user gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier, then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task creator is kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task creator will then get 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task doer, the task doer  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-star reviews. Then in the then giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task creator” (written in Blue color). But if a user clicks the unblock task creator button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task creator . Then the bot will unban the task creator from the bot as well as the group. Okay but if the completed button is clicked , it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. I also want you to know that if the giant message will then have the text “The guilty is the task creator” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task creator button) and for the second time in the future, if the task creator gets the report to taskifii button clicked by a task doer on a task they posted , the then giant message will  have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task creator”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task creator again” , then the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task doer [half the task fee they(the task creator) planned to pay the first victim task doer] birr and till they pay the second victimized task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) were supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr , the message will also include both of the task doer’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doers, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task doer) letting them know that taskifii has found the task creator guilty so the task creator [task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii  . And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task doer a message letting them know that a previous task creator they have worked with in the past by the name [task creator’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task creator) did to them (the task doer) in the past to another task doer , the message will also let them know that because the task creator repeated their mistake again , the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they pay half of the task fee they were supposed to pay them (the task doer) to them (the task doer) plus another corresponding task fee to the other task doer, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task creator sends the monetary punishment they (the task doer) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task creator to only click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task doer, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they send as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that they must now send the receipt of payment for the second victimized task doer. Then if the task creator gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will exactly wait till the first victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task doer the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version), and the message will let them know that a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name] has finally sent the punishment fee of [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the first victimized task doer] birr to them(the first victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will also wait exactly till the second victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then bot will send to the second victimized task doer the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “ I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task creator was supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr to them(the second victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will ban(or keep on banning) the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s telegram username, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to first victimized task doer], the task creator’s telegram username, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#FVTD” ,and “#unpaid2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button (which i will explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (first victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews each as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task doer would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task doer clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (and obviously fyi ,this sent button will appear  if the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens with more details , for now just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message(This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because both the task doers have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. Then also the bot will give the task creator 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews and the bot will also give both the task doer 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creator gave the task doer five-stars.And btw ,I forgot to tell you that ,as soon as the first victimized task doer or the second victimized task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task doer would have clicked the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task doer  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then the second receipt , the second victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s telegram username,  the second victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis ,the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to second victimized task doer] birr,  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#SVTD” ,and “#unpaid2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button  is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doers five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task creator again” text in it  and  for the third time or more in the future, if the task creator gets the report to taskifii button clicked by a task doer on a task they posted , then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttc”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task creator is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttc button , the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e making the task doer fix a mistake outside of the task description) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) was going to pay by the task doer] birr , the message will also include the task doer’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that after taskifii studied the case , the task creator has been found guilty so the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer). And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task creator to click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task creator) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), the bot will exactly wait till the task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,then the bot will send to the task doer the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the task doer] birr to them (the task doer), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task doer’s name with emphasis ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the task creator’s name with emphasis, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task creator’s email address with emphasis, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#TD” ,and “#unpaid3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions.  And as i told you before, the task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because  the task doer have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars. Then also the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 



Okay going back now, I also want you to know that if the giant message would have had the text “The guilty is the task doer” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task doer button) and next time if the task doer gets in the situation like this for the for the second time in the future (i.e in the future for the second time, if the task doer clicks the report to taskifii button for another task)   , the then giant message  sent will have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task doer”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task doer again”,  then the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first or the former victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr and till they pay the second or the current victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task creator) letting them know that taskifii has found the task doer guilty so the task doer [task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee/ monetary punishment fee to them(the task creators), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii. And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task creator a message letting them know that a previous task doer they have worked with in the past by the name [task doer’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task doer) did to them (the task creator) in the past to another task creator(a.k.a the second victimized task creator) , the message will also let them know that because the task doer repeated their mistake again , the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half of the task fee they were supposed to get paid by  them (the task creator)initially  to them (the task creator) plus another corresponding monetary punishment fee to the other task creator, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task doer sends the monetary punishment fee they (the task creator) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that they must give the receipt of payment for the second victimized task creator . Then if the task doer gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will wait exactly till the first victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task creator the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr to them(the first victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then also when the second victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,  bot will send to the second victimized task creator the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator] birr to them(the second victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t, they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task creator’s name with emphasis ,the first victimized task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the first victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr,  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#FVTC” ,and “#unpaid2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the first victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist),  the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( first victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (this is ofcourse if the second victimized task creator clicked the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens, just know there is a sent button involved in it ) (btw the same goes vice versa i.e if a user clicked the sent button or if the second victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the first victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that because both the task creators have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the first victimized task creator or the second victimized task creator clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button,both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task creator  will be unbanned from the bot and the group, then  the second receipt , the second victimized task creator’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis ,the second victimized task creator’s telegram username ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee of the task the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator],  task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#SVTC” ,and “#unpaid2”.

Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task doer again” text in it  and if the task doer gets in the situation like this  for the third time or more in the future (i.e in the future for the third time or more, if they click the report to taskifii button for another task), then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttd”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task doer is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttd button , the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has found them guilty by a situation(i.e for lying by saying i didn’t recieve the task fee) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the task creator] birr , the message will also include  task creator’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that after taskifii studied the case ,the task doer has been found guilty so the task doer  has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creator).

Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews.

And if the task doer would have clicked the non-agreed upon button before the time to click the non-agreed upon button was up, a message with a button attached below it labeled as “Cancel this report” will be sent to the task doer letting them know that they should send a message that explains at least one thing that is a non agreed upon work outside of the task description that the task creator insisted them(the task doer) to fix in the completed task/30% of it , the message will also let them know that they got 5 minutes to send the message or they won’t get another chance to report this. Then if the task doer doesn’t send a message within the 5 minutes or if the task doer clicks the cancel this report button within the 5 minutes   , the cancel this report button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked , then the bot will wait till the task doer sends the updated and completed task before the 30% of the revision time is up, in which if they do or not , the exact same thing or process will happen as i told earlier (i.e the process  i told you of what happens if the task doer sends the updated and completed task before the revision time is up rather than clicking the non agreed upon button )(and i will tell you later what will happen if the task doer doesn’t send the updated and the completed task within remaining time till 30% of the revision time is up).  But if the task doer would have sent a message or something to the bot within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button ,  the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has claimed that the task creator (in the message it will say “you”) is insisting them(the task doer) to fix something that is a non agreed upon extra work outside of the task description,  the message will also let them know that taskifii will get to the bottom of this and punish the one who is found guilty, the message will also let the task creator know that the taskifii team has a lot complaints like this to resolve so it might take a while till taskifii studies this case , the message will also let them know that they (the task creator) can’t unfortunately use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this.  And also from the task doer side a message (This message has an amharic version) will be sent letting them know that they have successfully sent the report claim to taskifii, the message will also let them know that they shall wait till taskifii team studies this case and gets to the bottom of it , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till taskifii gets to the bottom of this. Then both the task doer and the task creator will be banned from using both the group and this bot until i can study this case and confirm the one who is guilty and the way this happens is once the task doer gives a message or anything within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button , the message or something the task creator sent within first 15% of the revision time after clicking the fix button , the message the task doer sent within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button , the related file (if there is any), the final 30% of the completed task the task doer sent , the task post without the apply button, the task doer’s name with emphasis ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, the task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, and the  task creator’s phone number with emphasis will all be sent to another channel (which has the chat id :--1002432632907) as one giant message(which will have three hashtags in it saying “#nonagreedupon”, “#final30 and “#UnCompleted”) with seven buttons  attached below it labeled as “Contact Task Doer” , “Contact Task Creator”, “ keep blocking task doer”, “keep blocking task creator”, “Unblock task doer”, “Unblock Task creator” and “Completed” .  And if the contact task doer  button is clicked ,  it will take the user that clicked it, to the bot ,  and then  a message  will be sent to the user  through the bot  letting them know  that they should write a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then  if the user gives a message  or anything else,  it will be sent to the task doer.  But if the user clicks the contact task Creator button,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then a message will be sent to the user through the bot letting them know that they should write a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or anything else,  it would be sent to the task creator . 
 But  if the keep blocking task doer  button was clicked  by a user,  it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user  letting them know  that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task doer.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task doer later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task doer (i will explain how next) . Then  the bot  will send to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month” . And  then  if the user clicks  the day button , the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 days).  But if the user clicked the month button,  the bot will send  a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of months they want to ban the task doer . Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task doer , then the bot will ban/keep on banning  the task doer from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task doer from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task doer is banned/kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task doer will then get 5 one-star reviews as if  5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task creator, the task creator  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator five-star reviews. Then in the giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task doer” (written in red color).  But if a user clicks the unblock task doer button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task doer. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task doer . Then the bot will unban the task doer from the bot as well as the group.  But if a user clicked the keep blocking task creator button , it will take the user to the bot,  and then  a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must send a message here to the bot which in turn  will be sent  to the task creator.  Then  if the user sends a message or something to the Bot,  the bot will send it to the task creator later after the user gives the time period they want to ban/keep banning the task creator (i will explain how next). Then  the bot  will send  to the user a message  with two buttons attached below it  labeled as “Day” and “Month”.  And then if the user clicks the day button , the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should give the number of days they want to keep on banning the task creator. Then if the user  gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive  digits. But  if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit days(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the day button from earlier then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 days). Then if the user gives a reply that is not only positive digits,  the bot will send a message to the user letting them know that they should only give positive digits.  But if the user gives a reply that is only positive  digits,  the bot will send the message the user gave earlier to the task creator , then the bot will ban/keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for the number / digit months(i.e For example:-  if the user clicks the month  button from earlier, then gives a reply that says “5”  , the bot will keep on banning the task creator from using the bot and the group for 5 months). Then also whether the user clicked the day button or the month button ,  at the end, after the task creator is kept on being banned for a specific period of time set by the user, the task creator will then get 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews. But also to compensate  the task doer, the task doer  will  then get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-star reviews. Then in the then giant message , there would be a section in it where it will say “The guilty is the task creator” (written in Blue color). But if a user clicks the unblock task creator button , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they must give a message that will be sent to the task creator. Then if the user gives a message or something to the bot , it(the message or whatever the user sent) will be sent to the task creator . Then the bot will unban the task creator from the bot as well as the group. Okay but if the completed button is clicked , it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. I also want you to know that if the giant message will then have the text “The guilty is the task creator” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task creator button) and for the second time ,if the task creator gets a non agreed upon report from a task doer in the future (i.e if task doer sends a message within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button) , the giant message will then have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task creator”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task creator again” , then the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task doer [half the task fee they(the task creator) planned to pay the first victim task doer] birr and till they pay the second victimized task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) were supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr , the message will also include both of the task doer’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doers, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task doer will be un banned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task doer) letting them know that taskifii has found the task creator guilty so the task creator [task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii  . And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task doer a message letting them know that a previous task creator they have worked with in the past by the name [task creator’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task creator) did to them (the task doer) in the past to another task doer , the message will also let them know that because the task creator repeated their mistake again , the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they pay half of the task fee they were supposed to pay them (the task doer) to them (the task doer) plus another corresponding task fee to the other task doer, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task creator sends the monetary punishment they (the task doer) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally the bot will only allow the task creator to only click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task doer, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they send as the receipt . Then if the task creator gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that they must now send the receipt of payment for the second victimized task doer. Then if the task creator gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will exactly wait till the first victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task doer the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version), and the message will let them know that a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name] has finally sent the punishment fee of [half of the task fee the task creator was supposed to pay the first victimized task doer] birr to them(the first victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will also wait exactly till the second victimized task doer is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task doer is not doing anything in the bot or started anything in the bot) , then bot will send to the second victimized task doer the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “ I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) and the message will let them know that  a previous task creator by the name [the task creator’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task creator was supposed to pay the second victimized task doer] birr to them(the second victimized task doer), the message will also let them know that they will be banned from using taskifii till they click the i approve button if they actually recieved the task fee or click the i deny button if they didn’t. Then the bot will ban(or keep on banning) the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task doer will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis , the first victimized task doer’s telegram username, the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to first victimized task doer], the task creator’s telegram username, the  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#FVTD” ,and “#nonagreedupon2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button (which i will explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (first victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews each as if 5 task creators gave the task doer five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task doer would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task doer clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (and obviously fyi ,this sent button will appear  if the second victimized task doer clicks the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens with more details , for now just know there is a sent button involved in it ) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task creator and send a message(This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them know that because both the task doers have received the punishment fee, they(the task creator) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task doer and the second victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. Then also the bot will give the task creator 5 one-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews and the bot will also give both the task doer 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creator gave the task doer five-stars.And btw ,I forgot to tell you that ,as soon as the first victimized task doer or the second victimized task doer clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task doer would have clicked the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task doer  will be unbanned from the bot and the group(as i told you earlier , same goes if the i approve button was clicked ), then the second receipt , the second victimized task doer’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s telegram username,  the second victimized task doer’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task doer’s banking details with emphasis ,the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task the task creator was supposed to send to second victimized task doer] birr,  task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s telegram username, and the task creator’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttc” ,“#SVTD” ,and “#nonagreedupon2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button  is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task doer clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task doer/the second victimized task doer) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task doer and the first victimized task doer will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task creators gave the task doers five-stars each . Then once the task creator’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task creator as if 5 task doers gave the task creator one-star reviews, then they(the task creator) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii.

Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task creator again” text in it  and for the third time or more ,if the task creator gets a non agreed upon report from a task doer in the future (i.e for the third time or more in the future , if a task doer sends a message within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button for a task), then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttc”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task creator is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttc button , the bot will send to the task creator a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e trying to make the task doer fix a mistake that wasn’t theirs) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer [half of the task fee they(the task creator) was going to pay by the task doer] birr , the message will also include the task doer’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task doer, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that after taskifii studied the case , the task creator has been found guilty so the task creator has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task creator) pay half the task fee to them(the task doer). And then the bot will ban the task creator from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task creator to click the send receipt button and then send a message to the bot once.  Then if the  task creator clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task creator) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt .

Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task doer letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task doer will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task creator letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task creator from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that the task creator [the task creator’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task creator) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews.

Okay going back now, I also want you to know that if the giant message would have had the text “The guilty is the task doer” text in it (i.e if a user clicks the keep blocking task doer button) and for the second time  ,if the task doer gives a non agreed upon report in in the future (i.e for the second time in the future , if the task doer sends a message within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button) , the then giant message  sent will have one extra button attached below it which will be labeled as”Monetary punishment for Task doer”, and if a user clicks it , firstly there would be a text in the giant message saying “The guilty is the task doer again”,  then the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first or the former victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr and till they pay the second or the current victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. Then the second victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot as well as the group and a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to them (second victimized task creator) letting them know that taskifii has found the task doer guilty so the task doer [task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee/ monetary punishment fee to them(the task creators), the message will also let them know that they are no longer banned from taskifii. And the bot will also send a message to the first victimized task creator a message letting them know that a previous task doer they have worked with in the past by the name [task doer’s name] did the same terms & condition-breaking action they(the task doer) did to them (the task creator) in the past to another task creator(a.k.a the second victimized task creator) , the message will also let them know that because the task doer repeated their mistake again , the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half of the task fee they were supposed to get paid by  them (the task creator)initially  to them (the task creator) plus another corresponding monetary punishment fee to the other task creator, the message will also let them know that as soon as the task doer sends the monetary punishment fee they (the task creator) will be given an opportunity to confirm if they actually received the payment or not.  And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the first receipt) in any format , the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that they must give the receipt of payment for the second victimized task creator . Then if the task doer gives a reply (which i like to call the second receipt) , the bot will wait exactly till the first victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the first victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , then the bot will send to the first victimized task creator the first receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr to them(the first victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then also when the second victimized task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the second victimized task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) ,  bot will send to the second victimized task creator the second receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version) that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator] birr to them(the second victimized task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t, they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the first victimized task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the first receipt , the first victimized task creator’s name with emphasis ,the first victimized task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the first victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the first victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the first victimized task creator] birr,  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#FVTC” ,and “#nonagreedupon2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version)  will also be sent to the first victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the first victimized task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button(btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist),  the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year. Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( first victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user clicked the sent button or if the first victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the second victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button (this is ofcourse if the second victimized task creator clicked the i deny button, in which i will tell you soon what happens, just know there is a sent button involved in it ) (btw the same goes vice versa i.e if a user clicked the sent button or if the second victimized task creator would have clicked the i approve button, the bot will wait till either the first victimized task creator clicks the i approve button or till a user clicks the sent button) in which if they do , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task doer letting them know that because both the task creators have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to both the first victimized task creator and the second victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the first victimized task creator or the second victimized task creator clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button,both the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on , if the second victimized task creator clicks the i deny button,  firstly the second victimized task creator  will be unbanned from the bot and the group, then  the second receipt , the second victimized task creator’s name with emphasis , the second victimized task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s email address with emphasis, the second victimized task creator’s banking details with emphasis ,the second victimized task creator’s telegram username ,the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis , the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s name with emphasis, [half of the task fee of the task the task doer was supposed to get paid by the second victimized task creator],  task doer’s email address with emphasis, the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#SVTC” ,and “#nonagreedupon2”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the second victimized task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the second victimized task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button (btw , i want to point out that if the unsent button is clicked here first before  the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button (which i explain later ) is clicked , the unsent button that appears after the first victimized task creator clicks the i deny button will disappear or not exist. ), the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct , they have been banned from using taskifii for a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars each . Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. Moving on, If the giant message had the “The guilty is the task doer again” text in it  and for the third time or more ,if the task doer gives a non agreed upon report  in the future (i.e for the third time or morein the future , if the task doer sends a message within 5 minutes after clicking the non agreed upon button for a task), then the then giant message will have one extra button labeled as “3+Monetarypunishmenttd”, and if a user clicks it, there would a text in the then giant message saying “The task doer is found guilty for third time or more”, then if a user clicks the 3+Monetarypunishmenttd button , the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has studied the case and taskifii has  found them guilty by a situation(i.e lying by saying that the task creator insisted them(the task doer) fix a mistake that wasn’t theirs to fix) like this for the third time or more so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the task creator] birr , the message will also include  task creator’s name(with emphasis) and all their banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that after taskifii studied the case ,the task doer has been found guilty so the task doer  has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creator). And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task doer) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), when the task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , the bot will send to the task creator the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator] birr to them (the task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button.

If the  task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task creator’s name with emphasis ,the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#TC” ,and “#nonagreedupon3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because  the task creator have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii.

And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 
I also forgot to tell you that if the task doer clicked the approve button in which the task doer sent the middle 40% of the completed task after the time given for the task is up (till task fee reaches zero amount), the same thing will happen as if the task doer clicked the approve button in which the task doer sent the middle 40% of the completed task within the time given for the task (which i explained earlier), But the only difference here is that task fee amount is different (read the whole instructions to understand) and couple of other stuffs are also different(just read the whole instructions to understand).
And btw i forgot to tell you that if the task doer wouldn’t have sent the completed task/the final 30% of it  at all,  neither within the time given for the task nor even after that (i.e till task fee reaches zero) or if the task doer wouldn’t have sent the updated and completed task within the 30% of the revision time, a message will be sent to the task doer letting them know that they have been banned from taskifii for 5 months for not meeting their obligations, the message will also let them know that if they repeat this action again , there will be some monetary punishment to pay. Then the bot will ban the task doer from the bot and the group for 5 months. Then after the 5 months are up (i.e after the task doer is no longer banned from the bot and the group), the Bot will send a message to the task doer letting them know that they can now start using taskifii ,  the message will also let them know that they should be careful in not repeating this action again otherwise next time there would be monetary punishments to pay. If the task doer repeats this mistake for the second time again i.e not send the completed task at all (i.e if they don’t send the completed task neither within the time given for the task nor after that ,till task fee reaches zero),  the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that they have been found guilty by a situation like this for the second time so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the first victimized task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the first victim task creator] birr and till they pay the second victim task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the second victim task creator] birr, the message will also include both of the victimized task creator’s name(with emphasis on who is the first victimized and the second victimized) and all their banking details with emphasis on whose is which, the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creators, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept. A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the first victim task creator and the second task creator letting them know that the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creators). And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to them letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the first victimized task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt .

Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii  for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them (second victimized task creator/the second victimized task creator) (in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the second victimized task creator and the first victimized task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars each . Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version)  letting them know that they can now start using taskifii. And if the completed button is clicked, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 
If the task doer repeats this mistake ( i.e not send the completed task at all (i.e if they don’t send the completed task neither within the time given for the task nor after that ,till task fee reaches zero) ) for the third time or more, the bot will send to the task doer a message (This message has an amharic version) with a button attached below it labeled as “send receipt” (This button label has an amharic version) letting them know that taskifii has completed studying the case and taskifii has found them guilty by a situation like this for the third time or more (i.e not sending the completed task at all ( neither within the time given for the task nor after that ,till task fee reaches zero) for the third time or more ) so they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator [half of the task fee they(the task doer) was going to get paid by the task creator] birr , the message will also include  task creator’s name(with emphasis) and all their (the task creator’s) banking details with emphasis , the message will also let them know that they can’t use taskifii till they pay the task creator, the message will also let them know that they can click the send receipt button below to send the reciept.  A message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that the task doer has been banned from using taskifii till they(the task doer) pay half the task fee to them(the task creator). And then the bot will ban the task doer from using the group and the bot but exceptionally  the bot will only allow the task doer to click the send receipt button and send a message to the bot.  Then if the  task doer clicks the send receipt button , firstly the send receipt button will now stop doing anything if it gets clicked, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to them(the task doer) letting them know that they should now send the receipt of the payment for the task creator, the message will also let them know that they must only send the receipt because taskifii will take anything they give right now as the receipt . Then if the task doer gives any kind of reply (which i like to call the receipt), when the task creator is not in action using the bot (task posting, task doing, or anything that requires an action to end in the bot i.e basically if the  task creator is not doing anything in the bot or start anything in the bot) , the bot will send to the task creator the receipt and a message (This message has an amharic version)  that has two buttons attached below it labeled as “I approve” (This button label has an amharic version) and “I deny” (This button label has an amharic version) , and the message will let them know that  a previous task doer by the name [the task doer’s name]  has finally  sent the punishment fee of  [half of the task fee  the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator] birr to them (the task creator), the message will also let them know that if they have actually received the fee , they should click the i approve button but if they didn’t ,they must click the i deny button. Then the bot will ban the  task creator from the bot and the group till they either click the i approve or i deny button i.e the only thing they can do while being banned is only either click the i approve button or i deny button in which if they do, they will be unbanned from the bot and the group. If the  task creator clicks the i deny button , firstly the task creator will be unbanned from the bot and the group , then the  receipt , the task creator’s name with emphasis ,the task creator’s telegram username with emphasis , the task creator’s phone number with emphasis, the task creator’s email address with emphasis, the task creator’s banking details with emphasis , the task doer’s name with emphasis, the task doer’s phone number with emphasis, the task doer’s telegram username with emphasis, [half of the task fee the task doer was supposed to get paid by the task creator],  the task doer’s email address with emphasis, and the task doer’s banking details with emphasis will all be sent to channel that has a chat id of “-1002289847417” as one giant message that has 3 buttons attached below it labeled as “Unsent” , “Sent”, and “Completed”. The giant message will also have a couple of hashtags saying “#Uncompleted”, “#MonetaryPunishmenttd” ,“#TC” ,and “#undelivered3+”. Before i tell you what happens if a user clicks any of the buttons, i want you to know that a message (This message has an amharic version) will also be sent to the task creator letting them know that taskifii will study this case and get back with them with the final result and decisions. And as i told you before, the task creator will then be unbanned from the bot and the group. Moving on, if a user clicks the unsent button, the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them apologetically know that because of their misconduct (i.e lying about sending the punishment fee to the task creator) , they have been banned from using taskifii for  a year . Then the bot will ban the task doer from using the bot and the group for a year, then the bot will send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer [the task doer’s name] has been banned from using taskifii for a year because they (the task doer) lied about sending the punishment fee to them( the task creator)(in the message , it will say “you”), the message will also let them know that taskifii is really sorry for this inconvenience , the message will also let them know that they will be compensated by getting 5 five-star reviews. Then the task creator will get 5 five-star reviews as if 5 task doers gave the task creators five-stars. Then once the task doer’s year is up, the bot will give 5 one-star reviews to the task doer as if 5 task creators gave the task doer one-star reviews, then they(the task doer) will get a message (This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they can now start using taskifii . But if a user would have  clicked the sent button or if the  task creator would have clicked the i approve button , the bot will unban the task doer and send a message (This message has an amharic version)  to the task doer letting them know that because  the task creator have received the punishment fee, they(the task doer) can now start using taskifii. Then the bot will also send a message (This message has an amharic version) to the task creator letting them know that the task doer now doesn’t owe them any debt, the message will also thank them for cooperating with taskifii. And btw , as soon as the task creator  clicks either the i approve button or the i deny button, the buttons will then stop doing if they get clicked after that . And if a user clicks the completed button, it will change the  hashtag “#UnCompleted” in the giant message to “#Completed”, then the completed button label will change from completed to uncompleted in which if the user clicks the uncompleted button , it will change the hashtag in giant message saying “#Completed” back to “#Uncompleted” as well as it will also change the uncompleted button label from uncompleted back to completed. 

Now I am almost finished , there just a couple of things to tell you, starting from what the reply keyboards are but before I tell you about them , I want you to know that the reply keyboards won’t work if  the user is in action using the bot I.e task delegating, task doing, editing profile, setting up profile , task inquiry format , editing task post, and any other actions in the bot that requires the user to finish the action because if the user was already in action in the bot and then if the user clicks a button in the reply keyboard, it will ruin the flow of the system. And also when the user is in action and if they click any of the reply keyboard ,only for the first click , a message(This message has an amharic version) will be sent to the user letting them know that they can’t use the button’s function till they finish the action they started. Then after that nothing will happen if the user clicks any of the reply buttons when they were already in action. 
And if a user didn’t setup a profile , nothing will happen when they click any of the reply buttons till they setup a profile plus also no one can apply for a task post if they didn’t setup a profile (and when they click the apply button on any task post , they will get a message(This message has an amharic version) letting them know that they should setup a taskifii profile to use taskifii). 
 
And now moving on , the reply keyboards buttons  (This button label has an amharic version) are: “Find a task button”, “Post a task”, “terms&conditions”, “Edit Profile”, and  “language/ቋንቋ”. Then in perfect conditions, if the find a task button or the post a task button was clicked , the same thing will happen as if the buttons with same button label I told you earlier was clicked. But if the terms&conditions button was clicked , the bot will send the terms& condition statements to the user. But if a user clicked the edit profile button , the same thing will happen as if the edit profile button I told you about earlier was clicked.But if the language/ቋንቋ button was clicked , the reply keyboard buttons will be replaced by two buttons called “Amharic” and “English”. And if the user clicked the amharic button , firstly a message will be sent to the user letting them know language is Amharic from here on out, then the previous 5 reply keyboard will replace these two reply keyboards , then from then on out any message or button labels that has amharic versions will be sent to the user in their amharic version. But if the english button was clicked ,firstly a message will be sent to the user letting them know language is english from here on out, then the previous 5 reply keyboard will replace these two reply keyboards , then from then on out any message or button labels that has an english versions will be sent to the user in their english version.
 
And btw im almost finished with the instructions , I just wanted you to know that 3 buttons will be sent to channel with a chat id of “-1002616271109”,and the 3 buttons are : “Block everyone”, “Contact Everyone”,”Contact non profile setups”. And if a user clicks the block everyone button , it will ban every user from using the bot as well as the group, but if the Contact everyone button was clicked , it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they should send a message that will be sent to everyone that setup their profiles, then if the user sends a message to the bot, that message will be sent to every users that setup a taskifii profile.  But if the contact non profile setups button was clicked ,it will take the user to the bot, and then a message will be sent to the user letting them know that they should send a message that will be sent to everyone that didn’t setup their profiles, then if the user sends a message to the bot, that message will be sent to every users that joined the bot but didn’t  setup a taskifii profile.

And if a user that already setted up a profile doesn’t use the bot for 3 days , a promotional and friendly message will be sent to them once every day till the user uses the bot, the message let’s  them know taskifii misses them, the message will also let them know there are more opportunities to make quick and reliable money as a task doer with/without any skills and there also other opportunities to delegate any frustrating task remotely and quickly at their own prefered price, the message let’s them know that it’s time to level up and use their time to their advantage.
